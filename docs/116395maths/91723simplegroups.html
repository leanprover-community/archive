<p>I was just looking through what we have on group theory. </p>
<p>1) The definition of <code>simple_group</code> is incorrect -- the trivial group is not simple, for the same reason that 1 is not a prime number. I was going to fix this but then I realised I didn't know the idiomatic way to say "I am not the trivial group". How about demanding the existence of an element which is not the identity? Any better ideas? This is in <code>group_theory/subgroup.lean</code>. </p>
<p>2) We still only have Sylow 1? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> are you going to PR Sylow 2 and 3?</p>
<p>3) Do we have the canonical bijection of lattices (or whatever they are) between the lattice of subgroups of G containing the normal subgroup N, and the lattice of subgroups of G/N? And how best to say that this lattice preserves normal subgroups?</p>
