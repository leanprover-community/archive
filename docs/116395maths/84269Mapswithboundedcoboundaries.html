<p>Hi, I'm formalizing rotation numbers, and the proof relies on the following fact: if <code>f : α → β</code> from an additive monoid to a normed vector space satisfies <code>∀ x y, ∥f (x + y) - f x - f y∥ &lt; C</code>, then it can be approximated by an additive map.<br>
As far as I understand, the part dealing with limits should go to <code>analysis/normed_space</code>.<br>
What would be a good name for the map <code>[has_add α] [add_group β] (f : α → β) : α → α → β := λ x y, f (x + y) - f y - f x</code>, and what file would be a good home for this definition/lemmas?</p>
