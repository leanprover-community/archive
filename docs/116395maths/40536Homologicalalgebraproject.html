<p>There seems to be something called a "project' in mathlib for homological algebra <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/projects/2" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/projects/2">here</a>. I want to add things to it in some form -- I want to say "we should prove that a short exact sequence of complexes gives a long exact sequence of cohomology, we should do the Grothendieck spectral sequence, ...". What is the way to add my hopes and dreams to this project?</p>

<p>Or is that not the way it works?</p>

<p>I think you can create issues / PRs and assign them to the project either by clicking in the "Projects" section at the right of the issue page or from the project page itself. You can also create "notes" that only show up in the project by clicking the various + buttons on the project page. The official docs on github are <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards" target="_blank" title="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards">here</a>.</p>
