<p>I have written a new algebraic closure <a href="https://github.com/ChrisHughes24/leanstuff/blob/master/algebraic_closure_roadmap.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ChrisHughes24/leanstuff/blob/master/algebraic_closure_roadmap.md">roadmap</a> that covers the refactoring that needs to be done before algebraic closure is merged</p>

<p>What do you think about putting it in mathlib in the wiki pages? <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Future.20projects.20as.20Wiki.3F" title="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Future.20projects.20as.20Wiki.3F">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Future.20projects.20as.20Wiki.3F</a></p>

<p>I will have more to say about your general question in the other topic later, but this kind of planned refactoring is best as an issue on Github, I think.</p>
