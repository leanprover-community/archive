<p>Hi, what is the reason to introduce <code>cau_seq</code> in mathlib? When I first tried to understand what happens, presence of both <code>cau_seq</code> and <code>cauchy_seq</code> was really confusing. I can see that it makes some definitions computable but I don't think that <code>cau_seq</code> lead to any reasonable computable definitions. I mean, a computable Cauchy sequence without a computable estimate on the rate of convergence gives no information about the limit.</p>

<p>It is a bootstrapping thing. <code>cau_seq</code> does not rely on any topology for its definition, but it is superceded by <code>cauchy_seq</code></p>
