<p>Hi everyone, Happy to find this forum. I'm Kevin Sullivan, University of Virginia CS. I've been using Coq, and now Lean, and also Dafny, in teach graduate and undergraduate students, for several years. I'm ramping up the role of Lean. I haven't been a Lean dev, and so am likely to have some questions, concerns, comments, etc. about aspects of Lean that impinge on pedagogy. Very best wishes and thanks to all. --Kevin</p>

<p>Hi Kevin -- I'm Kevin Buzzard, a pure mathematician at Imperial College London. This autumn I'll be using Lean as part of my undergraduate mathematics teaching, in my introduction to proof course. As you can imagine I'm also very much interested in aspects of Lean that impinge on pedagogy. I hope to spend some time this summer making some good teaching materials for mathematicians; I currently have a bunch of stuff scattered around, and a bunch of ideas, but it seriously needs collating. One year ago I knew absolutely nothing about Coq or Lean or anything; I was just starting. I'm blogging as I learn at <a href="http://xenaproject.wordpress.com" target="_blank" title="http://xenaproject.wordpress.com">xenaproject.wordpress.com</a> .</p>

<p>Welcome Kevin! It's great to see more and more people using Lean in teaching. I'm Scott Morrison, a pure mathematician at the Australian National University. I'm not at all at the scale Kevin B is at yet, but I do have 3 maths undergraduates doing semester long projects with me at the moment in Lean, and I'm hoping to incorporate Lean in a larger way soon.</p>

<p>Maybe one day we will have a teaching stream here. I'll also experiment on real students during the spring term. I'll try to teach them how to write traditional maths proofs on paper after convincing Lean.</p>

<p>Yeah, there are quite a few people who have taught using Lean or who are planning to. Jeremy Avigad and I taught a intro math course at CMU; I'll be adapting that and teaching to a CS audience this winter. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span> and our boss are teaching Lean in a more advanced CS course this fall.</p>

<p>Just to advertise a bit <span class="emoji emoji-1f609" title="wink">:wink:</span> I'm hoping to make this a topic of discussion at our January workshop: <a href="https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/index.html">https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/index.html</a></p>
