<p>Its always interesting to find unexpected Lean theories: <a href="https://github.com/levjj/esverify-theory/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/levjj/esverify-theory/">https://github.com/levjj/esverify-theory/</a><br>
From a first glance, <code>esverify</code> is a Javascript/ECMAScript verifier, and these are some semantics with soundness...</p>

<p>A slightly unusual "Lean in the wild" story:</p>
<p>My partner was out at an aerials (circus stuff) class this evening, talking to someone, who at some point in the conversation asked "Coq or Lean"? (Context: they worked in CS at a research institute here in Canberra, my partner mentioned to them I was interested in automated theorem proving.)</p>

<p>I gave a talk in Cambridge two weeks ago and at the end of it Larry Paulson told one of his post-docs to go away and define a scheme in Isabelle, to prove it could be done. When he'd left I told the post-doc that I'd met people who were skeptical.</p>

<p>An example of a dependent type is a function which Johan will have seen, which takes a topological space and presheaf on it, and defines a function from the space sending a point to an element of the stalk of the presheaf at that point.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I know enough about schemes to know how to write them down in HOL. You essentially need to relativize everything, i.e. make every definition relative to a set. As far as I understand it, for schemes the biggest advantage of dependent types is that we can ad hoc use the subtype of a open set. This is not possible in HOL.</p>

<p>I understand from the "pitch to journalists" standpoint the 'crisis' story is great, and I fully appreciate that the mathematics literature is crap. Nevertheless, I think when talking to other mathematicians, I'd prefer to emphasise more the "this is fun" / "this isn't quite helpful yet, but if you pitch in someday soon this is going to be an awesome tool" / "if you don't pay attention now you're going to be a dinosaur" arguments.</p>

<p>"A case in point was Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s last theorem. Only a handful of experts were qualified to evaluate the dense, 200-page proof when it first appeared. "</p>
<p>This is extremely misleading. I'm not even sure that it is true, but even if it is true, within a year or two of the proof appearing there was a very detailed survey article by Darmon, Diamond and Taylor explaining the proof which needed only the kind of background which a graduate student working in this area in algebraic number theory would have, so hundreds and maybe even thousands of people were able to verify the proof within a couple of years of it appearing.</p>

<p>I could give a far harsher talk where I point out various serious mistakes by prestigious people and then point to various recent extremely technical papers by these same people which I know because of insider information did not go through as rigorous a refereeing process as they should have done and then flat out accuse the mathematical community of not having done its job correctly. I am not sure who is the crackpot but recent events in number theory have made me start to firmly believe that it's not me but them. I have thus far refrained from telling such stories in public, but believe you me this is why I am here in the formal proof verification community.</p>

<p>Exactly. There was some discussion about this a while back. The point is that however well we attempt to archive this site, you can't just email the man at Google to say "whenever someone googles for Lean questions, point them here and not at Stack Exchange please". Have you noticed more and more people coming out of the woodwork recently asking random questions? This guy today is asking about modules over a ring -- they have a mathematical background and they are going to SO not here. It's something we need to think about.</p>

<p>Guessing by Name. I was counting 4, but then Rob pointed out that Minchao's paper is also a Lean implementation.<br>
The concrete list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jeremy Avigad, Mario Carneiro and Simon Hudon.</strong> Data types as quotients of polynomial functors</li>
<li><strong>Mario Carneiro.</strong> Formalizing computability theory via partial recursive functions</li>
<li><strong>Minchao Wu and Rajeev Goré.</strong> Verified Decision Procedures for Modal Logics</li>
<li><strong>Robert Y. Lewis, Johannes Hölzl and Sander Dahmen.</strong> Formalizing the Solution to the Cap Set Problem</li>
<li><strong>Jesse Han and Floris van Doorn.</strong> A formalization of forcing and the consistency of the failure of the continuum hypothesis</li>

<p>Let me return to the main topic of this thread today (Lean papers in ITP). It's probably obvious to computer scientists, but I prefer to write it just in case. As was pointed out to the perfectoid team, forgetting to write that Lean is developed at Microsoft research is not helping to keep Lean funded. So everybody should make sure their papers and slides mention Microsoft research.</p>

<p>Is there any effort to collect and catalog copies of all Lean papers? I would be willing to maintain a bibtex bibliography of papers. One of the key problems of doing "independent research" (as I am) is that papers get locked behind paywalls or lost due to authors leaving the field.</p>

<p>I'd like write access to someplace where people would expect to find a lean bibliography (e.g. a link on the leanprover-community page. Anybody with write access could then add bibliographic entries to their (or other's) papers. A central resource for finding biblio links would make it easier to cite papers. A central repository of copies of the papers would mean that your bibliography could also include a hyperlink.</p>

<p>I note that a discussion began in the comments at <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11053" target="_blank" title="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11053">Woit's blog</a> .</p>
<p>I regard this sort of thing (online chat) as not unimportant. I have had over 1000 blog views in the last thee days, just from the fact that he mentioned my blog (the wordpress software tells me that people are clicking on his link) so I think we can assume (if we didn't know already) that Woit's blog is very widely read. If people feel that they have something to say about the issues being discussed there and want to contribute, I can pretty much guarantee that there is an audience reading it.</p>
<p>The reason they're not unimportant is that I am still convinced that the mathematical community is still overwhelmingly completely ignorant of software like Lean, and the more "chat" about it, the better.</p>

<p>I don't like the idea that there would be significant notational differences between  for all and lambda. I think we shouldn't have a completely different syntax for each binder. If we pick <code>.</code>, we should use it for <code>forall</code>, <code>exists</code>, etc</p>

<p>from the perspective, <code>\mapsto</code> doesn't use a letter so that frees up lambda but it does use an arrow which we always seem to run out of. Plus, my aforementioned point about homogeneity</p>

<p>I would actually prefer to use backslash than unicode lambda (but with lambda available as alternate notation). It would be nice if the core syntax didn't use so much unicode, since this makes it difficult for those that don't want to use a lean-approved editor</p>

<p>I would actually prefer to use backslash than unicode lambda (but with lambda available as alternate notation). It would be nice if the core syntax didn't use so much unicode, since this makes it difficult for those that don't want to use a lean-approved editor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there are non-unicode alternatives for lambda, though? Just like coq, I think you can type <code>fun</code> or <code>assume</code> for lambda, and so forth. The implication arrow is the very awesome <code>-&gt;</code>. I mean, you probably know this, so I'm not quite following.</p>

<p>I'm very close to creating a Twitter account only for the purpose of voting here. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> wouldn't it make more sense to have a GitHub vote? You could created and issue with one message per proposition, and we can use the emoji reactions to vote. I think the period option is really awful. I don't know any language (I mean real language, not programming language) where period is used for anything else than ending a sentence. In what sense does <code>λ x. e</code>ends after <code>x</code>?!? Of course every mathematician would vote for <code>x ↦ e</code> but I'd be happy to keep <code>λ x, e</code> if it is important for CS people.</p>

<p>Period is used in Isabelle. It took me a lot of time to get used to the comma in Lean, and in the end I think I prefer the period because the comma is already used to separate expressions in anonymous constructors. My point is rather that I would like to have two different symbols here, be it <code>. ,</code> or <code>, ;</code> say.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in thoughts about the arrangement of code for this sort of thing.  I think it's desirable to have a static snapshot on the arxiv and a maintained repository on github.  Certainly some of the code on my github repository could move into mathlib.  We could have a policy and/or aspiration that all code supporting a published paper should move into mathlib.  Or we could have a separate repository for that purpose, but still under leanprover-community and set up with travis so we can maintain compatibility with mathlib.</p>

<p>It's a little ambitious to expect everybody to keep their code up to date. An arxiv submission should contain git hashes of any dependent packages. Probably also a specific Lean version number too, in order to ensure reproducibility, maybe using Elan?

<p>In order to avoid incomplete versions, I and my students,<br>

<p>I think you're probably more concerned than I am :-) I think that when I was younger I would have been running around panicking, but now I understand the internet much better and it seems to me that most Lean stuff on the internet is sane, and then this one piece is a bit more extreme but it will just disappear into the general noise. I think much more interesting is Frank Calegari's claim that some humans completely understand the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, so I wrote a blog post about that instead. What do you think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> ? I can't quite work out if you're being serious. I mention the Vice article a bit at the beginning.</p>

<p>I guess my interest in proof checking stems from a very different thing, where we have a general proof that something is (unprovable? -- i dont want to say false), but in special cases can be proven true, the general cases tend to throw shade on the special case, and the special case tends to require a lot of setup... It's probably best if I just give an example...</p>
<p>like the idea that nand has no inverse and loses information, but in the case where nand is the partial application of a reversible universal logic gate like a fredkin gate, or a toffoli gate the complete gate has an inverse.  I like proof checkers for their ability to convey all these special assumptions, when trying to convey a counterintuitive truth ... This is somewhat the dual of Kevin's what if its false when we think it true I guess.</p>

<p>This comment from Hacker News is quite a marvel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMO the final paper had too much technical jargon which was convoluting some simple concepts.</p>
<p>This is symptomatic of IMHO the biggest single problem with the world of mathematics today. This discipline should be about developing ideas based on rigorous foundations and logic, which is a useful and important purpose. Once you have understood those ideas, even "advanced" results often seem quite simple and intuitive, and we can take that understanding and apply it to other work if helps us to make useful progress. However, the amount of needlessly obscure terminology, poor notation and just plain bad writing in formal papers make the whole field absurdly inaccessible, even to many who might have no trouble understanding the underlying concepts and important results.</p>
<p>Just imagine what would happen if we tried to write engineering specs or software the way postgraduate mathematics research is done. We'd be trying to debug source code where every identifier was a single character, taken from one of three or four different alphabets, with several of them looking similar enough to mistake one for another, with a bunch of combining accent modifiers on top that were used to fundamentally change the semantics of the program, interspersed with comments by someone who needs a remedial class in basic writing skills, full of technical terminology that is defined in terms of other technical terminology from other software packages, except that sometimes the meaning is subtly different in this context but that isn't noted anywhere on the screen at the time, resulting in needing to spend half an hour doing a depth-first-search of all the definitions only to find that a function whose only identifier is the name of the developer who wrote the second version (because the first person to work on it already has another function bearing their name) is actually equivalent to what a programmer would write as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>const DAYS_IN_WEEK := 7
</pre></div>


<p>I write this as someone who studied mathematics to a high level and has touched on the field many times since in connection with heavily mathematical software development. It's the worst sort of closed-world gate-keeping, and we could do so much better, but sadly inertia and vested interests are not our friends in this matter.</p>

<p>Mathematica won in the computer algebra field for a simple reason. It had the best documentation. The learning curve for any computer algebra system is quite steep and all of the other systems relied on "learn by trial".</p>
<p>Now look at Lean. Take, for example, group.lean. It is a wall of text. Finding a theorem relies on odd names like mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul. The whole of the "communication" with people, such as it is, is contained in that name. Programmers made the mistake of this "pile of sane" (POS) approach, witness the "src", "inc", "tst", and (usually empty) "doc" directories with "semantic naming" like parser.c, <a href="http://SMTFuns.pl" target="_blank" title="http://SMTFuns.pl">SMTFuns.pl</a>, or <a href="http://catsim.ml" target="_blank" title="http://catsim.ml">catsim.ml</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose, instead, there was a group theory textbook in latex. The textbook explains the ideas in natural language. It contains all of the lemmas in group.lean, each  one with a paragraph or so of explanation. The lemmas are in named "chunks", basically a verbatim block with a name. Lemmas should only be accepted when they contain a paragraph or section in the group theory volume.</p>
<p>Now you have a book, with a table of contents, a table of equations, chapters, sections, paragraphs, an index, and a bibliography, all hyperlinked and searchable. Since each lemma is in a named verbatim chunk you can extract any or all lemmas automatically, letting the compiler do it. You can find relevant lemmas by looking in the table of contents or the index.</p>
<p>Code to extract a named chunk is 170 lines of C. Axiom already uses this technology.</p>
<p>The idea is called "literate programming" (Knuth). You write for people, and incidently, write for the machine. And, as a benefit, you get a book to publish, which counts on your resume rather than a file of code that doesn't.</p>

<p>I'm one of the authors of Axiom. Axiom was a commercial competitor to Mathematca and Maple. It was considered "one of the big 3". I got a lot of feedback from professors who taught using computer algebra, including those who contributed to Axiom. Documentation mattered for teaching and students kept using what they knew.</p>

<p>That's the main obstruction. The fact that we don't have étale cohomology groups, or even just the discriminant of a number field, or whatever.</p>

<p>Take a calc textbook. Shake out all of the equations and paste them on index cards. Throw away the words. Now teach calculus from the index cards. The group.lean file is "just the equations", i.e. just the index cards. If all of mathematics were reduced to a wall of 200-character named lemmas I'm not sure it would get much use.</p>

<p>I don't know who's right. My experience talking to mathematicians is the same as Johan -- they're not interested because the things they do aren't there. However in 5 years' time when they <em>are</em> there, documentation will most definitely be an issue. Whether it contributes now or not is something I don't know. I am trying to write documentation for maths undergraduates, but progress is slow because I have a busy job :-/</p>

<p>Take an introductory textbook on group theory. Shake out all the theorems and lemmas and paste them on index cards. Throw away all the words. Now try to find a corresponding entry for each index card in <code>group.lean</code>. For &gt;50% of the index cards, you won't find an entry. On the other hand, for 90% of the lines in <code>group.lean</code>, you won't find an index card...</p>

<p>I'm suggesting that the "library" format for lean is books, not files. Of course the group theory "book" would be written to hold the current lemmas surrounded by paragraphs (useful for word searching). New lemmas would update the book. I'm not suggesting "decorating" an existing group theory book with the lemmas.</p>

<p>One clear problem is that probably 5% to at most 10% (just a guess, an authority can jump in if they please) of the lemmas in <code>mathlib</code> are actually even stated in a mathematics book. At the very least, in mathlib proofs of important and hard, "real", propositions and theorems are often chopped up in order to remain manageable. I think just the act of <em>stating</em> many of the broken-up pieces as they are phrased in lean would be totally unbearable to read in a mathematics book. Imagine, for example, such a direct translation of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean</a><br>
So much is "obvious". That's not even to say it's not worth checking---it just stands in the way of understanding.</p>

<p>but even if it does grow to millions, most of those lemmas wouldn't benefit much from extensive documentation. <br>
i suppose the normal workflow is the following: you encounter a technical issue in one of your proofs that is intuitively obvious but would be bothersome to prove. you use library_search or some other lemma search tool to resolve the technicality, and then go on with your proof.<br>
there's really not much beyond the lemma type that matters.</p>

<p>You can have a look at more recent files, where we are precisely trying to enforce more documentation, but at places where it is useful -- i.e., there are nonobvious definitions or design decisions. For instance <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean</a>, that I wrote recently and for which the more than 100 comments in the PRs made me vastly improve the documentation. Does it correspond to what you are looking for, or how would you envision things for better documentation?</p>

<p>I'm looking at several systems (COQ, AGDA, IDRIS, HOL, ISABELLE). HOL88 is interesting because it is implemented in Common Lisp and I can embed it in Axiom directly (which is also Common Lisp). Lean is interesting in particular due to Jeremy Avigad. I used it a bit and now I'm trying to communicate between it and the compiler. Axiom is typed everywhere, at every level, and is dependently typed so I need a robust system.</p>

<p>FWIW I figure most people don't use ITPs because being formal is a chore. Nobody cares about Bourbaki, and nobody cares about convincing a computer they are correct. In that sense they are a solution in search of a problem. I think they will take off once we true believers formalize enough math and develop enough useful tactics that the software starts being a net gain in productivity as opposed to a 10x reduction.</p>

<p>Andrew, I'm not sure how far tactics can carry you toward that goal. The undecidability issue is an issue. Axiom uses heuristics at runtime to resolve type questions that can't be computed at compile time. I expect to run into the same issue once I try to prove some of Axiom's algorithms correct. Also, tactics have to somehow be related to the specification language of the algorithms and I'm not sure what to think about that connection yet. It is still an "open research question" for me.</p>

<p>I see that Axiom wants to call Lean under the hood. Is it feasible that I could call Axiom from Lean and get a proof certificate for things that a CAS can do? For example, I would love to call out to a cylindrical alg decomp algorithm, or matrix decomposer alg, or symbolic integrator.</p>

<p>Andrew, that's exactly the goal of the Axiom Sane project. Axiom should be a trusted oracle for computing algorithms. Libraries like complex numbers, computing primes, doing CAD, etc. are easy in Axiom but providing a trusted algorithm and a proof certificate is the center of the research question. The oracle response should provide the answer and a proof that the checker can check</p>

<p>The idea of "encoding all of mathematics" doesn't seem to mention the computer algebra field.

<p>I think that Andrew's suggestion is the more profitable angle here. Rather than attempt to have lean be a component of axiom, see if you can modify axiom to produce certificates of its results that can then be checked in a theorem prover like lean</p>

<p>The problem with treating Axiom as a black box is that you don't trust it, and the very purpose of the project seems to be to make it more trustworthy. The only way you can achieve that is either by whiteboxing the algorithm and proving it correct, or by having the algorithm validate any outputs it gives by producing proofs alongside.</p>

<p>There is an interesting talk by John Seale (of the Chinese Room fame), that is related to the question of "machine checked proofs".<br>
I suggest you take careful notes of the definitions he uses in the first 5 minutes as the whole talk rests on them.<br>

<p>I watched 23 minutes but I hesitate to continue. Is there any moment when he does something else than repeating: "let's laugh together at how stupid are people who disagree with me" and "the computer is not intelligent because it has zero intelligence"?</p>

<p>Although others have done it before, and probably they've even done it better (Patrick showed me some impressive stuff I remember), I wonder if we can just get some sort of little suite of games like this, just to get people interested.</p>

<p>yes, it's the obtain tactic. the proof code certainly still needs to be cleaned up, especially before contributing anything to mathlib. many non-terminal simps, lots of duplication and several instances where i miss-use <code>let</code> and should use <code>have</code> instead :)</p>

<p>I'm not sure arguing a lot about this is a good use of our time. Writing better documentation and tutorials seem like a better idea to me.</p>

<p>My default search engine is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" title="https://duckduckgo.com">duck duck go</a>, and I usually get to the mathlib github repo by searching for the word mathlib, because it's usually the second or third hit. But as of the last 24 hours or so it's consistently been number 1. Is that true for everyone or just me? I thought the point was that they weren't tracking me.</p>
