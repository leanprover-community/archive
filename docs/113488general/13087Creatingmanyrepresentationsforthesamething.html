<p>As an example, mathlib defines the matrix type, and a lot of class instances for it. Now, I can represent the information of a n by 1 matrix in a vector type of length n. What would be the easiest way to get all the type class instances like has_add and add_comm_group by creating a bijection?</p>

<p>This is a great question :-)</p>

<p>I think the answer is that we need a tactic to do this and it's not there.</p>

<p>Some theorems are in equiv/algebra but I'd prefer to have a tactic</p>

<p>The tactic is called <code>transport</code> and it has been discussed at great length, but it's seen almost no use. Partly because it's not as magical as we would like it to be.</p>
