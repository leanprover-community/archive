<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm running in some issues with well foundness. I defined a function using the using_well_founded key word and a well founded relation that I defined.<br>
My function is running fine in the VM, but it seems like the kernel is not computing the function at all, for instance when I'm applying reflexivity.<br>
I don't even get a timeout, the elaborator just fails immediatly.</p>
<p>Did anyone encountered similar issues with well foundness blocking computation in the kernel?</p>

<p>Yep, I just ran into this - see Mario's answer in ( <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/noob.20question%28s%29/near/170801612" title="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/noob.20question%28s%29/near/170801612">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/noob.20question%28s%29/near/170801612</a> ). The kernel will properly reduce structurally recursive calls, but not ones using <code>well_founded.fix</code>.</p>
