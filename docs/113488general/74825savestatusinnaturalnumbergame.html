<p>So the natural number game is doing the rounds again on reddit and the one comment which comes up again and again and which I can't fix is that if people lose their tab, then they "lose their progress". People sometimes don't realise that they can just go to any level at any time, but even those that do feel sad that they lost all their proofs.</p>
<p>I want to start working seriously on the real number game now, and if there is one thing I could change about the infrastructure it would be this. It will be a big change though, I would imagine. I remember <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132175">@Mohammad Pedramfar</span> saying something about getting people to log in -- but is there some way of avoiding this?</p>

<p>alternatively, you could hook up a database and add a button that stores the progress in that database when clicked and gives you an url to use to get your progress back</p>

<p>I would recommend avoiding any kind of server-side thing except as a last resort, since you'll have to maintain it somehow and probably deal with GDPR stuff.</p>

<p>Both transparent storage and file storage would be useful (the advantage of file storage is you can use multiple computers).</p>

<p>It's actually not too difficult to implement it. My viva is scheduled for next week, so I'm a bit busy now. I'll implement it shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have an idea about how many people played the game, if one can do that without being too intrusive. Could you store something like a hash of the ip when someone completes more than a couple of levels? Then you could count those hashes, without having any mean to reconstruct the ips.</p>

<p>I do know the Xena project blog stats -- it typically gets 100-200 views in a day, except for when something goes a bit viral, when it shoots up for a small period. For example it got 500 yesterday, and it got 3000 on Feb 29 when something (I forget what -- hacker news or something) picked up on a recent post. </p>
<p>If anyone wants to write a guest post or whatever I would be happy to discuss. I have 8 half-written posts which I should probably concentrate on at some point.</p>

<p>That sounds good. I'll look into stuff like google analytics to see if I can make it work that way.</p>

I haven't set this one up myself, so I'm not completely sure, but Google Analytics seems to do everything with zero hassle.<br>
All you would need to do is to set up a Google Analytics account and then add the few lines described here to the beginning of the root html file of the game. <br>
<a href="https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics" title="https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics">https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics</a><br>
In fact, if you go to  <em>Lean-game-maker/src/interactive_interface/public/index.html</em> and add the those few lines there, then it will be there when you run the game maker.</p>
