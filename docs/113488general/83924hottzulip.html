<p>I wanna dive a bit more into HoTT. See whether the benefits of univalence such as transfer are as cool as I think they are. And also check whether it doesn't create nuisances in practice when formalising ordinary non-homotopy maths. Since Zulip is awesome, I've created: <a href="https://hott.zulipchat.com/" target="_blank" title="https://hott.zulipchat.com/">https://hott.zulipchat.com/#</a><br>
You're heartily invited to join, if you are interested in HoTT.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="259452">@Bas Spitters</span> has already publicised the chatroom on the HoTT github page. I'm looking forward to some fruitful and engaging discussions!</p>

<p>Is there a simple explanation of what is easier/harder in HoTT from the point of view of a person who writes proofs and doesn't care about logic / type theory foundations?</p>

<p>You should ask over there (-;</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="233147">@Ulrik Buchholtz</span> I had a couple of really interesting conversations with you about HoTT in Pittsburgh and perhaps this Zulip chat would be a great place to have more. I still am confused about whether HoTT is actually what I as a mathematician want, and <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/more.20more.20basics/near/191080471" title="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/more.20more.20basics/near/191080471">Mario's remarks on another thread here</a> are exactly the kind of things which make me worry.</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads-up; I've joined.</p>
