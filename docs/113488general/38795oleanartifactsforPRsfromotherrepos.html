<p>Is it true that CI only builds downloadable oleans for PRs that come from local branches on the leanprover-community repo, and that PRs from peoples' forks don't generate downloadable oleans?</p>

<p>I'd hoped to have oleans for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2083" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2083">#2083</a> when I checked it out, but they don't seem to be there even though CI liked it.</p>

<p>Yes, this is true. But note that CI isn't building the tip of the branch that you made the PR from, it's building a merge commit with master. So you wouldn't get oleans anyway.</p>

<p>Oh.. I thought somehow in the last few days I was successfully getting oleans from azureedge for PRs that I was looking at. Maybe I was over optimistic.</p>

<p>If the PR is coming from a leanprover-community branch, you'll get oleans, since CI will build the branch as well.</p>
