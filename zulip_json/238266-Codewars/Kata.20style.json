That said, it doesn't involve any particularly advanced lean or maths, only a rough idea of the sets API and a very basic understanding of monads. As I see them, the options here are: 1) Present the kata essentially as above, with no hints. 2) Provide a link to the paper but no other information. 3) Provide an approximate lean framework for how the proof might look, so that users can fill in the gaps (but not enforce that the framework must be followed). Any suggestions?</p>",
