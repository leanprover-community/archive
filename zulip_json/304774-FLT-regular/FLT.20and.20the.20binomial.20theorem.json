The polynomial factorization is this:</p>\n<p>(a+b-c)^n =(c-a)(c-b)g(n) for any n even and</p>\n<p>(a+b-c)^n=(a+b)f(n) for any n odd.</p>\n<p>What makes this factorization true (and interesting) is that to get this, we assume that a^n+b^n=c^n. </p>\n<p>Finally we get a general solution for a,b,c by finding the n'th root of both sides and solving for the appropriate variable. </p>\n<p>Thank you if you read this far.
