I am going to avoid Langlands--Tunnell but I will still need Jacquet-Langlands for sure (over totally real fields) and also base change. However out of all the things on my todo list, these two things are <em>at the bottom</em> because (a) they're the part of the argument I understand the least (b) they were proved well before FLT and (c) I only have 5 years. Other things I will initially not be touching include Mazur's theorem and class field theory. If all other stuff gets done and we end up reducing the result to stuff like this from the 70s/80s then I would take Mazur and CFT over the analysis any day.</p>",
