In Mathlib, the existence of the equality symbol is implicitly assumed, since equality is defined for all formulas regardless of their languages. But in FFL, the equality symbol is treated as one of the relational symbols, because we want to work in a more general setting (I understand this is convenient in the context of model theory, but we put more importance on proof theory).</p>\n<p>For theories with equality, creating mutual translations is certainly straightforward. One need only add or remove the equality symbol, or simply define it redundantly through an obvious interpretation.</p>",
