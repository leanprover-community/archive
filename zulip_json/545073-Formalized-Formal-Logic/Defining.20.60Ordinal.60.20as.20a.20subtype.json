I noticed that in Foundation.FirstOrder.SetTheory.Ordinal.lean, <code>Ordinal</code> is defined like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">@[</span><span class=\"n\">ext</span><span class=\"kd\">]</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">structure</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Ordinal</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">where</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">val</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">V</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">ordinal</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">IsOrdinal</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">val</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The definition <code>def Ordinal := {α : V // IsOrdinal α}</code> seems to be equivalent, which would include lemmas about Subtype. However, the line <code>@[ext]</code> would no longer work, and <code>Subtype.eq</code> would have to be used in its place. I'm wondering if this the reason why a structure was used in place of a subtype? (Is it also agreed to be more readable to use a structure instead of a subtype?)</p>",
