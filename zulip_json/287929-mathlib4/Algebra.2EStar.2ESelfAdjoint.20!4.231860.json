That PR was eventually merged, but neither he nor I knows what the resolution to that problem was, and yet that PR did eventually get merged. </li>\n<li>Naming: <code>selfAdjoint R : AddSubgroup R</code>, but we frequently (primarily?) use <code>selfAdjoint R</code> as a type in its own right, so <code>SelfAdjoint R</code> seems more appropriate even though <code>selfAdjoint</code> follows the naming conventions. Thoughts?</li>\n<li>Naming again: when naming a lemma with a <code>Subtype.val</code> coercion, we are supposed to call those <code>val</code>, right? Not <code>coe</code>? It seems Mathlib4 is split on this according to the docs.</li>\n<li>There were several places where unification in Lean 4 seemed weaker than in Lean 3 (because I had to add type ascriptions). This came up recently in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/unification.20weaker.20in.20lean4\">another thread</a>.</li>\n</ol>",
