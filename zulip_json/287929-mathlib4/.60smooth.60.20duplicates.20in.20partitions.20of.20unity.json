I thought we had dropped this duplication some time ago in mathlib because it was mostly noise. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"634338\">@Michael Rothgang</span> , do you know if this duplication is an accidental outcome of the upstreaming from Sphere Eversion, or if it's there on purpose for some good reason?</p>",
