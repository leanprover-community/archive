        "content": "<p>I'm not sure yet if this would be a good change or not, but I wonder if Lean 4 allows us to change notation like <code>f ≤ᶠ[l] g</code> to something like <code>f x ≤ᶠ[x ∈ l] g x</code>. It may be more convenient if <code>f</code>, <code>g</code>, or both of them are already in the form of <code>fun x =&gt; expr</code>, especially in <code>calc</code> blocks. Similarly, can we move <code>x</code> in the notation for integrals to the end like we write in informal texts? AFAIR, the main reason for having it before the expression in Lean 3 was technical difficulty of writing the parser.</p>",
