I have been learning about Lean4 in my spare time, and I am convinced that the industry can benefit from certified programming a la Adam Chlipala. Recently, I tried contributing to the HepLean project, and I formalized the Schur decomposition during the process. I would like to upstream <a href=\"https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean/blob/6d47ea18a09fd38cb3c73c67da22bf8b788f078a/HepLean/Mathematics/SchurTriangulation.lean#L289\"><code>Matrix.schur_triangulation</code></a> to Mathlib. Since this is my first time contributing to Mathlib, how should I go about this? Also, is anyone working on formalizing the Jordan normal form? If not, I would like to give it a try.</p>",

Then, generalize to linear maps with more than one eigenvalues by way of <code>DirectSum.Decomposition</code>. From my experience with proving the Schur decomposition, it's easier to start with linear maps. Then, the decomposition of a matrix can be justified with <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/PiL2.html#Matrix.toEuclideanLin\"><code>Matrix.toEuclideanLin</code></a>.</p>",
