However we found that <code>ModuleCat.extendScalars</code> need the universe of <code>ModuleCat</code> on the right exactly equal to  <code>max u v</code> where <code>v</code> is the original level of universe and <code>u</code> is universe of <code>S</code>.<br>\nI am imagining using shrink to generalize this to assuming <code>Small.{v'} S</code> and <code>v \\le v'</code>,then we are able to define the version for universe <code>v</code> to universe <code>v'</code></p>",
