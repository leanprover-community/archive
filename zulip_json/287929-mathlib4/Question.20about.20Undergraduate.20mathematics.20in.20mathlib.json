I suppose my question extends to <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html\">this</a> list and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html\">this</a> list as well. I ask because the first one I looked at in the list was the Special Linear Group under Linear Algebra on the \"Undergrad math not in mathlib\" page, but I quickly found that it IS implemented in mathlib (see <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/d3298500e6d853c0856bebdb79d46f430b6a5e5e/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/SpecialLinearGroup.lean#L12\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/SpecialLinearGroup.html#Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>So, is this list reliable, or did I just find a rare mistake? Or am I missing something? Is there still work to be done on the Special Linear Group?</p>",
