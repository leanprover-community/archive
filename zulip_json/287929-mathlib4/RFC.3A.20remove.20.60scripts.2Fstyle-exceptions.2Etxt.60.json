As I understand it, the length of this file is meant to reach zero - and now, it indeed has. <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></p>\n<p>Some of the linter errors were easy to fix (and just required sustained effort), such some misformatted author lines or missing documentation. The main remaining entries were exceptions for the \"long file linter\", which has been rewritten as a syntax linter (in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15610\">#15610</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16299\">#16299</a>). Exceptions are now tracked as <code>set_option linter.style.longFile &lt;number&gt;</code> instead, obviating the need for this file.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this impliest the need for file with transient style exceptions is gone. All remaining text-based errors are the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>missing or malformatted copyright header; malformatted authors line</li>\n<li>missing module docstring</li>\n<li>broad imports such as \"import Mathlib.Tactic\"</li>\n<li>the string \"adaptation note\" (instead of the command #adaptation_note)</li>\n<li>using the wrong kind of cdots (rewriting this as a syntax linter has been bors-approved)</li>\n<li>isolated \"by\" or \"where\"; starting a line with a colon; a space before a semicolon</li>\n<li>trailing whitespace or windows line endings</li>\n<li>the second line of a statement is not correctly indented</li>\n<li>a space after \"←\"</li>\n<li>non-terminal simps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these should be introduced in new code; I don't see a reason for keeping an escape hatch for the current linters. Thus, I propose removing <code>style-exceptions.txt</code>.</p>",
