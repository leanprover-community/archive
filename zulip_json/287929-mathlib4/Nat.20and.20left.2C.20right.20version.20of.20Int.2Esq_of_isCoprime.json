I found <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/Int/Basic.html#Int.sq_of_isCoprime\">Int.sq_of_isCoprime</a>, but no version of this for natural numbers. It's a bit of a nuissance to convert the natural number facts to integer apply <code>Int.sq_of_isCoprime</code>, then cancel out the negative square result etc. So any reason to not have the Nat version in mathlib? I'd be happy to add it if no issues</p>\n<p>Also the <code>Int.sq_of_isCoprime</code> should have left and right version in my opinion, as that feels more like other theorems in mathlib.</p>",
