This is different than just pages on the website not being updated. I think we need a plan for some of these.</p>\n<p>The things I removed were:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>from the documentation section:</p>\n<p>In addition to the pages generated for each file in the library, the docs also include pages on:</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html\">tactics</a>,<br>\n  - <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/commands.html\">commands</a>,<br>\n  - <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/hole_commands.html\">hole commands</a>, and<br>\n  - <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/attributes.html\">attributes</a>.<br>\n- A couple of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/docs/tutorial\">tutorial Lean files</a></p>\n<p>from the guidelines section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/doc/commit_convention.md\">commit naming conventions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>In particular, I think we need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new commit naming convention file (or webpage on the community site), although the precise outcome is not exactly clear to me from <a href=\"#narrow/stream/144837-PR-reviews/topic/mathlib4.20PR.20titles\">this discussion</a>; the poll went one way, but then it seemed there was some support for a compromise at the end of the thread. If we can come to a conclusion there, I can create this file/page and link it from the readme.</li>\n<li>A way to list tactics, commands, hole commands and attributes, even if it means we have to manually tag things. I know we have <code>#help</code>, and while that's handy especially when you're in the middle of something, it's not as nice as the lists we had in Lean 3 on the website.</li>\n</ol>",
