Is this something that would be a good fit for mathlib?</p>\n<p>More precisely, the main theorem is: the set of scattered orders (those which do not contain a copy of the rationals) is equal to the smallest set of linear orders containing every singleton order and that is closed under well-ordered and reverse well-ordered lexicographic sums. The project also contains a proof that every linear order has a well-ordered cofinal subset.</p>\n<p>Here is the repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/avoair/Hausdorff.git\">https://github.com/avoair/Hausdorff.git</a></p>",
