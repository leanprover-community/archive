This doesn't work for <code>List.perm_comm</code> as it doesn't have an explicit argument with type <code>Perm</code>, so the name uses an underscore instead to match the usual naming convention.<br>\nSo you can find many examples of <code>_comm</code>  and <code>.symm</code> for different types in mathlib.<br>\nAs for the capitalization I think this is still a bit in flux so wouldn't want to say that is completely correct</p>",
