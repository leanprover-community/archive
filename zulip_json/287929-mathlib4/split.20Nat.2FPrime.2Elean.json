Motivation is that <code>Factorization/Basic</code> imports <code>Data/Nat/Prime.lean</code> and I have a new lemma for <code>Prime</code> that needs stuff from <code>Factorization/Basic</code>, but that lemma (and many others) certainly does not belong in the main <code>Prime</code> that gets imported for the <code>Prime</code> definition.  <code>Prime.lean</code> is simply ripe for splitting IMO. I would like to hear opinions on the whole matter, and pointers to documents or threads are highly appreciated, as this would be my first maintenance attempt.</p>\n<p>In Detail, I think a case can be made to have:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Nat</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">Prime</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"c1\">-- Basic.lean</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"c1\">-- MinFac.lean</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"c1\">-- Infinitude.lean</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"c1\">-- Misc.lean</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Is there consensus for names like <code>Misc</code>, <code>Lemmas</code>, <code>Other</code>, or such?</p>",
