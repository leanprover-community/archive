I'm exploring the use of Lean 4 for formalizing statistical models, and I was wondering if there’s any existing guidance or libraries for representing parametric, nonparametric, or otherwise predefined statistical models. I tried searching for “parametric models” in the mathlib or community resources but didn’t find much that seemed related.</p>\n<p>If anyone has pointers—whether design patterns, relevant definitions, or example developments—I’d really appreciate it. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nZixiao</p>",
