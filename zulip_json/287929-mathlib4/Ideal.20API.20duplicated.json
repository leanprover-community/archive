This means we can't use tactics like <code>simp</code> or <code>aesop</code> to make use of the much more complete <code>Submodule</code> API when proving membership in an <code>Ideal</code>. Of course, I could just copy the lemmas across, but that would add duplication. Given <code>Ideal</code> is just meant to be an <code>abbrev</code>, is this duplication intentional, and how can it be solved?</p>",
