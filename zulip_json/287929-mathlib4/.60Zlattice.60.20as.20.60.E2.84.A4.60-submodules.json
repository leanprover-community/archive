It was probably because that is what is used in Minkowski Convex Body Theorem, see <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MeasureTheory.exists_ne_zero_mem_lattice_of_measure_mul_two_pow_lt_measure#doc\">docs#MeasureTheory.exists_ne_zero_mem_lattice_of_measure_mul_two_pow_lt_measure</a>. However, after having to write too many <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=AddSubgroup.toIntSubmodule#doc\">docs#AddSubgroup.toIntSubmodule</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=AddMonoidHom.toIntLinearMap#doc\">docs#AddMonoidHom.toIntLinearMap</a>, I became convinced that <code>Zlattice</code> should be <code>ℤ</code>-modules. So I made <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16604\">#16604</a> to see what that would look like.</p>\n<p>So my question is: do you think a <code>Zlattice</code> should be a <code>AddSubgroup</code> or a <code>Submodule ℤ</code>?</p>",
