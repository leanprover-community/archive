This error happens both in mathlib CI (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/actions/runs/16151919972/job/45585039542?pr=26221\">example log</a>) and when building locally. It takes the form of <em>12</em> warnings on line 2, column 2 of the last file: <code>unknown identifier '#0'</code> --- so on the first meaningful line of the copyright header. Except that the copyright header looks perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>Does any of the experts here have any idea what is going on, or how to debug this further? (Whatever the actual cause of the error is, the error message is <em>terrible</em> because it does not help me debug this, at all.)</p>",
