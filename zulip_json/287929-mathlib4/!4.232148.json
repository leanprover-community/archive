Yet somehow all the rules are being suspended for <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17743\">#17743</a>, and porting of the file it touches is being put on hold. Given the effort that authors of other mathlib3 PR's – including myself – have put into jumping through all the forward-porting hoops, it seems highly unfair that this particular PR is being feather-bedded.</p>\n<p>This is all the more puzzling given that <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17743\">#17743</a> is, quite frankly, a mess. As has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, it does not pass CI, and never has done. Development there has been stalled since mid-January. It is built on shaky foundations since there are unresolved design issues with an instance diamond in <code>circular_order</code>. Finally, the mathematical structure it deals with seems something of a niche interest: the file <code>circular_order</code> has precisely zero imports in the library. </p>\n<p>Please, let's un-revert and merge <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/2148\">!4#2148</a> so we get <code>to_interval_mod</code> ported. It's a prerequisite for lots of important stuff: e.g. the complex log function, and <code>add_circle</code>, which is foundational for the whole Fourier theory library and also for a bunch of number-theory results around Diophantine approximation.</p>",
