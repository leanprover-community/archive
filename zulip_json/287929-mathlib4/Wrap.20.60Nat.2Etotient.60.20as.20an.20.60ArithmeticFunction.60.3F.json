        "content": "<p>It seems that currently we don't have an <code>ArithmeticFunction</code> version of Euler's totient function in Mathlib. Existing identities of <code>Nat.totient</code>, like <code>Nat.sum_totient</code>, is much elegant in the language of arithmetic functions (<code>ϕ * ζ = id</code>). Some well-known identities like <code>μ * id = ϕ</code> can be also proved in a neat way.</p>\n<p>So I've made PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/28676\">#28676</a> to wrap <code>Nat.totient</code>as an <code>ArithmeticFunction</code>. Note that <code>\\varphi</code> is used to distinguish from <code>Nat.totient</code>'s notation <code>\\phi</code>, since in many circumstances both <code>Nat</code> and <code>ArithmeticFunction</code>is opened in the context. But this might be controversial. Suggestions are welcome!</p>",
