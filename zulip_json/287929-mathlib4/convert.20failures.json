I haven't made a self-contained example, but I have a conjecture: maybe in the mathlib3 version <code>convert</code> got to use the expected type to help it elaborate the expression proposed for conversion, and in the mathlib4 version it doesn't.  Does this sound plausible?  If so, can it be changed?</p>\n<p>I noticed a discussion on the lean4 repo this morning about <code>show</code>, which seems like it could be similar:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/fedf235cba35ed8bf6bf571cf38e6d8536b904ac#r95249776\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/fedf235cba35ed8bf6bf571cf38e6d8536b904ac#r95249776</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/474f1a4d39bac6310fbd47aa4545d6c15fb14d53\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/474f1a4d39bac6310fbd47aa4545d6c15fb14d53</a></p>",
