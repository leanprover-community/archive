As used in e.g. Agda: <a href=\"https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/Relation.Binary.Definitions.html\">https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/Relation.Binary.Definitions.html</a></p>\n<p>Specifically, if <code>R</code> is transitive, then its negation <code>fun x y =&gt; ¬(R x y)</code> is cotransitive. This is distinct from intransitivity or antitransitivity. Important examples would be &lt;, &gt;, ≠, ≤, and ≥.</p>\n<p>I ask because the function <code>destutter</code>is usually used with ≠, or if not, with other cotransitive properties. Lots of nice lemmas about it can be proven if you assume <code>[Contransitive R]</code> -- except that <code>Cotransitive</code> doesn't seem to exist. :)</p>",
