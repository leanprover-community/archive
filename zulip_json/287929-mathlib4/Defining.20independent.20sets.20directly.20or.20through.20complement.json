My gut feeling is that the former is the better way, since this allows people to just work with independent sets directly if that's what the statement is about without switching to the complement (and having an additional <code>rw</code> step). It's also how one would define it in graph theory course. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306601\">@Kyle Miller</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"246273\">@Bhavik Mehta</span></p>",
