This has several advantages as far as I can see. Firstly you can do the boring job of noting the mathlib3 commit immediately, and not a few days later when you've forgotten which commit it was. Secondly it's a powerful way of making it known that you're working on the file, it's easier to spot because there are far fewer mathlib4 PRs than there are lines of code in the horrible port status wiki file. Thirdly while you're at it you can make the mathlib3 PR freezing the file and cross reference the PR and now you've done pretty much all the admin work necessary. I copy the autopprted file over, fix the imports, add <code>set_option autoImplicit false -- **TODO** remove this</code> and just push and PR and then get going and keep pushing as I go.</p>",

The mathlib3 version gets this by implementing it over <code>apply_rules</code> (rather than over <code>solve_by_elim</code>, which does backtracking).

It makes me wonder if it would be better to reimplement it by applying directly the right lemma: look at the head of the term, and choose the lemma to apply based on that. For instance, if you are proving that <code>λ x, cos (sin (x + 3 * exp x))</code> is continuous, notice that the head is <code>cos</code> and apply directly <code>continuous.cos</code>. If we have <code>n</code> possible heads, it should be possible to choose the right lemma in <code>log n</code> steps and then I hope performance should be good. I'm curious if this would be easy to implement, and if the performance would indeed improve by an order of magnitude (which is what we need to make <code>continuity</code> really usable).</p>\n<p>Of course, this kind of experimentation is for after the port!</p>",

But my point is not that I want more lambdas and matches in goals, but rather that if you write <code>simp [someFunc]</code> then it's your fault that lean unfolded <code>someFunc</code> and not lean's fault. If we leave the current behavior in lean4 as is, we would have to write more boilerplate simp lemmas, or perhaps upgrade simps to generate the proper simp lemmas that we want. But there are times where I do <code>dsimp [thing1, thing2, someFunc]</code> where I <em>want</em> lean to unfold <code>someFunc</code> and in lean3 it was annoying to have to use <code>unfold</code> on a second line as well in some cases.</p>",

The fact that in some sense we are \"95.7 percent of the way to group cohomology\" sounds great but also gives no real indication of how much work is left. \"37 files to go!\" would be more helpful at this point. Conversely, with the \"all\" category the percentage is very much unmisleading.</p>\n<p>Indeed out of our 8 currently chosen target files, they're all over 90% done and most are over 95% done, so someone giving a cursory glance might conclude that there's no point joining in because probably they'll all be done next week. A perhaps more useful representation of the amount of work left to do for the target files at this point would simply be the number of files left in the pdf, which cannot be computed by the data being presented because the difference between the numerator and denominator of the displayed fraction is always more than this for some reason I've never really understood (someone once explained it to me as \"tactic files\", but if they're not on the pdf I'm not interested: for example in group cohomology the difference is 41).</p>",

Then you and I started experimenting with Lean 3 and we realised that actually making basic group theory, ring theory, topological ring theory etc was not hard at all, it's just that nobody was doing it because nobody in the community particularly cared about it. Category theory on the other hand was struggling a bit, with Scott having universe problems and having to include category instances etc etc, and also with it being connected to nothing else in the library at the time. However with the port to mathlib4 I feel like currently things are a little bit returning to the old days: I have ported some category theory files and on the whole they sail through (modulo perhaps some issues with <code>simp</code> not behaving), whereas the algebraists are complaining about splitting fields and the analysts are complaining about differentiation. This might just be random noise though; if we have got to 80% (which, as Oliver pointed out to me on Friday, is really more like 95% given all the work that people like Mario and Gabriel and others have put in in order for us to even <em>start</em> the porting procedure) then one has to be optimistic that all the noise we're running into now is nothing more than noise.</p>",

I think a lot of the variation in ease-of-porting we're seeing comes down to how much defeq abuse (abuse is maybe overstating it) the mathlib3 library was using; many things have changed in Lean4 that then cause problems. I think in the \"trivial\" parts of the category theory library, it was smooth sailing, mostly because we were pretty good at avoiding defeq abuse (some old horrors like <code>opposite</code> notwithstanding). Now that we're porting algebraic geometry we're seeing some of the same issues: there are worryingly many appearances of <code>erw</code> in setting up Spec and Scheme and so forth, and sure enough this is now causing troubling during porting.</p>",

Not sure if that's worth changing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is kind of irrelevant for the applications of <code>jacobi_theta</code> to zeta values; it's there in order to link up with the general modular forms code. So I wouldn't lose any sleep if it were removed. But the manifold stuff has to get ported sooner or later anyway so it's debatable whether removing it is a real gain.</p>",
