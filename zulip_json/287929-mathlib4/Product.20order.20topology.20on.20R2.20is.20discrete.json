I also haven't made any unusual definitions, just used what is already provided in Mathlib. So how could this happen?</p>\n<p>Lean/Mathlib automatically produces the partial order (actually, we only need a preorder) ≤ on ℝ. The definition is what one would expect.</p>\n<p>Mathlib automatically generates a preorder ≤ on ℝ×ℝ. This is the product order, which is probably the most commonly used option, but other orders are possible (e.g. lexicographic).</p>\n<p>Mathlib's Preorder class automatically generates a strict preorder &lt; on ℝ×ℝ by a&lt;b := a≤b∧¬b≤a. This seems fairly standard, but in this case is not topologically reasonable.</p>\n<p>Mathlib defines Preorder.topology to be generate by the open sets {x|x&lt;a} and {x|a&lt;x}. This is a standard definition, but there is an approach which only uses ≤ and defines generating closed sets, and yields the Euclidean topology.</p>\n<p>While each step may (at first sight) seem reasonable, overall the result is something which is wrong, at least in how a human would interpret the result.</p>\n<p>My view is that there are a number of issues here, in decreasing order of severity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Automatically providing a strict preorder &lt; from a reflexive preorder ≤ is the biggest culprit. (I've already raised this; see <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"287929\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Preorder.20.2F.20PartialOrder.20synthesised.20.3C/with/571117877\">#mathlib4 &gt; Preorder / PartialOrder synthesised &lt;</a> ). While it might be \"standard\" in order theory, it doesn't make sense topologically (where &lt; should be open and ≤ closed). Because it's automatically generated, users don't necessarily see it. Because it's a strong property, one can prove many things based on it which might not be true using a more natural &lt; for your applicaton.</li>\n<li>Automatically generating the product order on the product type. Actually, for this particular application it's not so bad, except that for consistency with the order topology generation, one should have (a,b)≤(c,d) := (a&lt;c∧b&lt;d)∨(a=c∧b-d) so that the automatically generated &lt; on ℝ×ℝ is (a,b)&lt;(c,d) ↔ a&lt;c∧b&lt;d, so the user should choose which ≤ is suitable. More of an issue is if is one wants a different order e.g. lexicographic, graded lexicographic; it seems that Mathlib uses a new type (e.g. Lex (ℝ×ℝ)) because the order is associated with the type.)</li>\n<li>Generating the order topology from &lt; rather than ≤. Actually I think it is the better choice to define the generating open sets from &lt;, since defining the generating closed sets from ≤ is much more complicated. But it is inconsistent with 1) and 2). I believe that there is a StongLT which gives the right strict order. But this is not automatically generated, and doesn't seem to implement Preorder (so can't be used for the order topology) (maybe I'm missing something from the docs). Advising users to use StrongLT for the product order topology may recover the correct results, but doesn't prevent stating and proving R2_is_discrete.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More generally, I am uncomfortable with all the automatic generation going on. Maybe for arithmetic, there's only one natural +,-,× on a structure. Maybe for discrete mathematics, the automatically generated typeclasses and operations all make sense. But for order relations, there are multiple commonly-used orders on the same set, and having notation '≤' an intrinsic part of any preorder relation looks like it will be restricting and open subtle errors (in how users interpret symbols). (I also see there are ways around this.)</p>\n<p>One might argue that the theorem is correct, and the user just has to interpret it's meaning properly. But I think this is a dangerous viewpoint, especially for developers of formal methods tools and libraries. Users can already have high trust that there are no bugs in the kernel and that proved theorems are formally correct. But if the statement doesn't correspond to natural and expected usage, people will believe things that are not true. Also, it shouldn't take an expert to notice such mistakes. Sometimes differences with common mathematical usage will be necessary, such as when combining different theories with different conventions. But it's much better to be explicit about what the usage is, than rely on (locally unstated) assumptions as to what the default usage is. In the example above, there's no mention of ≤ or &lt; in the statement, yet alone of how they are defined, yet mismatches in expectations of the meaning between different Mathlib parts causes a big problem.</p>",

In fact one of my first Lean projects involved an alternative order on finite sets, where in my inexperience I made custom notation for the new order (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16681-5_5#Sec10\">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16681-5_5#Sec10</a>) and showed it forms an <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=IsLinearOrder#doc\">docs#IsLinearOrder</a> provided the underlying type formed a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=LinearOrder#doc\">docs#LinearOrder</a>. The more modern approach (implemented for this example by Yaël and Violeta) is to use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Colex#doc\">docs#Colex</a>, like <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Finset.Colex.instLinearOrder#doc\">docs#Finset.Colex.instLinearOrder</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"1015002\">Pieter Collins</span> <a href=\"#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Product.20order.20topology.20on.20R2.20is.20discrete/near/571674826\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This post shows that the Euclidean topology can't arise as the order topology of a total order; it doesn't say anything about strict partial orders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's a fair point, it seems to me that the strict partial order on the product is relatively rare to consider! </p>\n<p>Indeed Birkhoff's definition of <code>&lt;</code> on partial orders is equivalent to mathlib's, with the comment \"This notation and terminology are generally accepted\", and on page 61 comments \"We also note that it does not work at all to take “open intervals” as a basis of open sets.\", with the specific counterexample being the Cartesian plane with the product order (matching mathlib). </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"1015002\">Pieter Collins</span> <a href=\"#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Product.20order.20topology.20on.20R2.20is.20discrete/near/571674826\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The definition uses closed sets under ≤, not open sets under (strong) &lt;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This doesn't seem accurate, at least from the edition of Birkhoff that I have. The definition of the order topology on a complete lattice on page 59 uses the supremum and infimum of sets, as a limsup+liminf definition, and then the definition of the order topology on a partial order on page 60 uses the definition on its corresponding Dedekind-Macneille completion. Lemma 1 claims that all the closed intervals are closed sets, but doesn't claim that the closed sets are all generated by closed intervals. In particular, the topology on a partial order whose closed sets are generated by the closed intervals is called the interval topology in Birkhoff, and the remark after Theorem 4 explains that this can be strictly weaker than the order topology, with proof in Example 2. <br>\nYou also say that the textbook defines the order topology for arbitrary lattices, I presume you intended to mean arbitrary partial orders?

If your question is about how we could formalise that, this is a great application of either type synonyms, or the IsPartialOrder class.

Though probably weird things can happen if the order is not complete. One could also define a limit without going to the completion, though I would guess this is different, in general.</p>",
