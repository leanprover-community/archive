I am now looking to shift back closer to the theoretical side and contribute to the Lean community.</p>\n<p>I'm deeply impressed by the state of mathlib, but I feel that Functional Analysis and the Geometry of Banach spaces are currently underrepresented compared to areas like Algebra or Classical Analysis. I would like to express my strong interest in focusing my contributions on this branch of the library. I am currently seeking guidance on the best way to start, but here are my proposed initial contributions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Formalize Missing Core Theorems: I want to start by tackling foundational theorems from the 1000+ Theorems list. My top priorities are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Basic properties and charactrizations of reflexive Banach spaces including Goldstine's Theorem.</li>\n<li>Eberlein–Šmulian Theorem: Relating different kinds of weak compactness.</li>\n<li>Fixed Point Theorems: Generalizing results like Brouwer's theorem to Banach spaces.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work on Open Issues: I plan to review Functional Analysis-related issues and documentation TODOs on GitHub. I've seen several TODOs in the API Documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Review PRs: I'd be happy to offer my mathematical expertise to review PRs related to functional analysis concepts, though I recognize this may be a better activity once I am more familiar with mathlib's conventions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm new to the process of contributing to a large repository like mathlib. I would greatly appreciate any guidance from core contributors, especially those familiar with the functional analysis library's current structure and priorities.</p>",
