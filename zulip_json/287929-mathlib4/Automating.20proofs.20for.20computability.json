Moreover, in many cases, it is possible to derive proofs automatically from the definition of the function (in the first place, any effective function defined in Lean which is not marked as <code>noncomputable</code> would be computable). Therefore, I believe that, similar to <code>Continuous</code> or <code>Measurable</code>, it should be possible to automate proofs using Aesop for computability. Is there a specific reason why such attempts have not been made yet?</p>",
