I've now set up a mathlib4 version at <a href=\"http://speedcenter.informatik.kit.edu/mathlib4\">http://speedcenter.informatik.kit.edu/mathlib4</a>. It compiles every new commit on <code>master</code> once; we'll see how long that will scale. For now I've retroactively benchmarked a few old commits to get a sense of the evolution of build times. Unsurprisingly, lines go up, though you can also see the positive impact of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/2003\">lean4#2003</a> for which I specifically selected the adjacent commits. If there are any other interesting commits for which you want to see the specific deltas, I can add those to the queue as well. <a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/qQts4DBBVNLLe3ENxQ_pQs0-/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/qQts4DBBVNLLe3ENxQ_pQs0-/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/qQts4DBBVNLLe3ENxQ_pQs0-/image.png\"></a></div><p><a href=\"http://speedcenter.informatik.kit.edu/mathlib4/repo-detail/e7b27246-a3e6-496a-b552-ff4b45c7236e?zoomXStart=1667257200000&amp;zoomXEnd=1678921200000&amp;dimensions=build%3Aelaboration%3Awall-clock%3Ainterpretation%3A.olean%20serialization%3Acompilation%3Atypeclass%20inference%3Adsimp%3Ainitialization%3Aimport%3AC%20code%20generation%3Acompilation%20new%3Anorm_num%3Aring%3Aparsing%3Alinting%3Atask-clock%3Asimp&amp;dayEquidistant=true\">http://speedcenter.informatik.kit.edu/mathlib4/repo-detail/e7b27246-a3e6-496a-b552-ff4b45c7236e?zoomXStart=1667257200000&amp;zoomXEnd=1678921200000&amp;dimensions=build%3Aelaboration%3Awall-clock%3Ainterpretation%3A.olean%20serialization%3Acompilation%3Atypeclass%20inference%3Adsimp%3Ainitialization%3Aimport%3AC%20code%20generation%3Acompilation%20new%3Anorm_num%3Aring%3Aparsing%3Alinting%3Atask-clock%3Asimp&amp;dayEquidistant=true</a></p>",

The latter is particularly interesting, apparently memory usage jumped from 2GB to 4GB at the beginning of Feburary, which must be due to a single dominating file <a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/tCuz3UyEzGIT-W29xUeZ-LUU/image.png\">image.png</a> .

When you say things like \"Of course a normed field is a nonassoc-semiring and of course this is true in precisely one way\", I think what you are (or at least, I am) implicitly doing is something like \"well, all that matters is the data fields and they're the same no matter what because there is no reason to change them as you add structure\", the first part of which is essentially flat structures and proof irrelevance. The second part is of course borked if you choose to change one of the data fields to something propeq but not defeq, but even if not, Lean still has to check it, whereas a mathematician wouldn't because they generally only care about propeq anyway.</p>\n<p>However, when you have diamonds, especially with things that aren't just forgetful functors, I think it's less obvious, even for mathematicians, especially when what you really care about is defeq instead of propeq. As evidence, I'll point two several of the non-defeq diamonds we've accidentally inserted over the years and then later had to remove (e.g., <code>ℕ</code> smul), or the time a few months ago when I wanted to add an instance that every <code>ℂ</code>-algebra is an <code>ℝ</code>-algebra, but I did it in a naive way and then ended up with non-defeq diamonds, whereas I thought everything was fine. In this case, I actually contemplated briefly the possibility of diamonds ahead of time, but thought I would be okay, and I wasn't (this situation never appeared in mathlib, only locally).</p>\n<p>At the same time, it would be great if we could find a nice way to make this as easy for Lean as it seems to be for mathematicians. <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span></p>",

We probably don't need all commits, it is probably sufficient to capture some representative noise spread as well as any major perf changes in lean. If we can find good clusters, that might be one way to significantly reduce the number of benchmark variables, which would help make it more informative compared to the current wall of numbers with unclear significance</p>",
