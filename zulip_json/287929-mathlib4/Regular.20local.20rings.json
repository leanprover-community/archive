The main goal is to gain more experience working with Lean, but it would be nice if we could also contribute to Mathlib.  </p>\n<p>Regular local rings are currently not defined in Mathlib.  The plan is to start with the proof that regular local rings are domains, and then move on to some other relatively straightforward facts relating regular local rings and regular sequences.  If we become more ambitious, it would be fun to formalize the Auslander-Buchsbaum-Serre theorem that regular local rings are characterized by finite global dimension, a result that we just covered in my graduate commutative algebra class.</p>\n<p>If there are some people actively working on regular local rings, please let me know so that we can pivot to a different project.</p>",
