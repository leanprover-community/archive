How to correctly formalize the statement \"<code>StarSubalgebra</code> which is WOT-closed is a von Neumann algebra.\"?</p>",

The way to formalize that statement would be to have a <code>def</code> which produces <code> vonNeumannAlgebra</code> and takes as input a <code>StarSubalgebra</code> and proof that it is WOT closed. But please refrain from doing this for now. The PR is already very long as is, and it's going to need lots of cleaning up before its ready for primetime, so adding new material will only slow down the review process.</p>",

The proofs you have written are quite long, and probably that means things should be factored out into lemmas, but I won't know until I have time to look thoroughly next week.</p>",
