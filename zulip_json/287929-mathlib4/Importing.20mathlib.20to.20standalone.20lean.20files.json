Now i am trying to import mathlib without using lake or building a lean project, as i need each lean file to be a standalone. Is it possible to do this? If so how? I have attempted cloning and building mathlib locally within the same directory, but import does not look locally rather within the following: \"No directory 'Mathlib' or file 'Mathlib.olean' in the search path entries:<br>\n/home/dell/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.16.0/lib/lean\". I've attempted to manually extract these files from a project and adding them into that directory however i get error that header does not match.</p>",
