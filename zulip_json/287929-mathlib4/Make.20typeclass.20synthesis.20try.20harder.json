There are other occasions of this occurring in mathlib, e.g. <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Module.finitePresentation_of_finite#doc\">docs#Module.finitePresentation_of_finite</a>, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Module.finitePresentation_of_projective#doc\">docs#Module.finitePresentation_of_projective</a>, and (one direction of) <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=posMulStrictMono_iff_mulPosStrictMono#doc\">docs#posMulStrictMono_iff_mulPosStrictMono</a> etc.<br>\nI wonder if it makes sense to throw them all into a <code>scoped[TryHarder]</code> for discoverability, where the user is intended to find the right instance and <code>attribute [local instance]</code> it. And possibly a linter against opening it in mathlib.<br>\nWe might even be able to lump all the \"not instance due to diamond\" things in it as well.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I kind of like the idea. What if there is an <code>ExpensiveInstances</code> sub-namespace that theories can populate, so maybe you'd do <code>open scoped Module.ExpensiveInstances</code>? If you already have <code>Module</code> open, it would just be <code>open scoped ExpensiveInstances</code>, and I think the way <code>open</code> works is that this will do <code>open scoped</code> on <em>all</em> <code>ExpensiveInstances</code> namespaces that are currently accessible.</p>",
