Here it is:<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"387244\">Yaël Dillies</span> <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12493#pullrequestreview-2042349276\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that you are removing the <code>IsCentralScalar</code> instance but not the <code>IsScalarTower</code> one makes me think you're doing something wrong. Reading through, I am not getting a feeling I understand what should be in this file vs <code>Data.DFinsupp.Lemmas</code>.</p>\n<p>Here is a suggestion: People (eg @_<strong>_Sky Wilshaw</strong>) have wanted finitely supported functions where the support is not the set of elements not sent to <code>0</code>, but instead the set of elements not sent to a specific fixed element <code>a</code>. Tentatively, this means that <code>Finsupp</code>/<code>DFinsupp</code> have an interpretation as non-algebraic objects and that we should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a file/folder under <code>Data</code> for everything that can be said about <code>Finsupp</code>/<code>DFinsupp</code> without algebra (past the use of <code>0</code>, for now)</li>\n<li>Have a file/folder under <code>Algebra</code> for algebraic uses (most of the material we currently have, I think)</li>\n<li>Have a file/folder under <code>Order</code> for purely order theoretic uses (there is currently very little of that)</li>\n<li>Have a file/folder under <code>Algebra.Order</code> for the algebraic order theoretic uses (that we have a bit)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also note that when thou change <code>DFinsupp</code>, thou shalt change <code>Finsupp</code> too. I'm happy for it to be in a separate PR to avoid having to shuffle everything twice until I give you the green light, though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
