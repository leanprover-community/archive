The problem seems to be that powers in a product of semigroups (which has a semigroup instance) is not defeq to component-wise powers.  This is the same problem (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#Design-note-on-AddMonoid-and-Monoid\">described in Mathlib.Algebra.Group.Defs</a>) that led to the inclusion of ℕ powers into the definition of monoid. </p>\n<p>One solution is to add PNat powers to the definition of semigroup.  This clears up the diamond, but leads to another problem: monoids extend semigroups, so with the existing definition of monoid, we would have both ℕ+ powers and ℕ powers.  If we wanted a <code>[Pow M ℕ+]</code> instance from anything with <code>[Pow M ℕ]</code> structure (this seems reasonable to me), this could lead to another diamond, unless we make the powers defeq.</p>\n<p>Does this mean we need the monoid <code>npow</code> to use the semigroup <code>pnpow</code> somehow?

JacobiZariski is full of results about commutative rings and is just \"normal\" commutative algebra, it is still a complete mystery to me why this is so slow: it's not even schemes, it's just commutative rings. Rather than just assuming that everyone knows the history of the weirdness of that file, let me summarise some stuff here:</p>\n<p>1) Changing the definition of semigroup as Jireh has just done in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/22517\">#22517</a>, to match our definitions of monoid and group, results in a <code>+11.392⬝10⁹</code> increase in the number of instructions for <code>Mathlib.RingTheory.Kaehler.JacobiZariski</code>. (This is recorded as <code>(+1.61%)</code> but the only reason the percentage is so low is that this file is already taking an absolutely absurdly large number of instructions, far more than any other file in mathlib)</p>\n<p>2) Conversely, changing the <em>names of the universe variables</em> in that file so that they are in a different alphabetical order, as is done in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21129\">#21129</a> , results in a huge decrease of <code>-210.979⬝10⁹</code>.</p>\n<p>3) I explained <a href=\"#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/kernel.20universe.20normalization.20issue/near/496355201\">here</a> that the kernel was taking a suspiciously long amount of time checking <code>rfl : thing.{max u v w} = thing.{max (max u v) w}</code>. Sebastian pointed out that an issue might be that a key complicated definition was an <code>abbrev</code> and suggested that it be changed to a <code>def</code>, and gave some evidence that this might help.</p>\n<p>4) Christian tried making the abbrev into a def in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21364\">#21364</a> and a bunch of proofs broke (unsurprisingly) but when he sorried them it turned out that <code>JacobiZariski</code> was still slow :-( </p>\n<p>So my conclusion is that we have still not got to the bottom of things. I don't know whether JacobiZariski is a red herring when it comes to this PNat issue but I thought I'd mention it because I was reminded of the file when it was flagged by CI in Jireh's PR.</p>",
