I'm not sure whether anyone is actually actively working on formalizing the JCT itself, but I think having an agreed-upon statement even without a proof would unlock a lot. For example, I am working on defining the interiors of polygons, but to do this right requires the JCT. So what will the JCT look like? Will the ambient space be only <code>EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)</code>, any manifold homeomorphic to that, or something else? How is the statement itself likely to look?</p>",
