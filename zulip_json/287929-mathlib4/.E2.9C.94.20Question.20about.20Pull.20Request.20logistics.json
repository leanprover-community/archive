We never made a pull request and I am now working on having everything with the correct conventions so we can do it. </p>\n<p>On the Lean's website it says the following: \"If you've made a lot of changes/additions, try to make many PRs containing small, self-contained pieces; in general, the smaller the better! This helps you get feedback as you go along, and it is much easier to review. This is especially important for new contributors as it prevents wasted effort.\"</p>\n<p>I am now wondering if that still applies in our case. Should I send small pull requests with smaller properties, even if the new file we are creating would not have much use without the rest? Should I just combine everything we have done so far and then make a pull request? </p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your time!</p>",

I'd suggest making a big PR with all your changes anyway, but expect that reviewers will ask you to split it up. Reviewing code is (strongly) superlinear in the length of the PR - that is, it'll typically be much faster to get ten small PRs landed than a single one that contains everything in those ten.</p>",
