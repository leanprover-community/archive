Please wait for its completion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't know which action it's talking about, but I get the same message when I try to fetch the whole cache from VSCode interface. <code>lake exe cache get</code> works fine though. Has anyone encountered the same issue? Is there a way to only fetch the cache for the focused file with command line? I was under the impression that there was not.</p>",
