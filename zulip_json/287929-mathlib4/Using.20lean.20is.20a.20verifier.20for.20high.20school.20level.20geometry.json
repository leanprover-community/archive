It will not be impossible but right now there are no good teaching resources. I learnt something about how mathlib handles this kind of mathematics when I reviewed the PR adding <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Archive/Imo/Imo2019Q2.lean\">this file</a>, which taught me a lot about how Joseph had set things up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To ask more precisely- are all the basic level geometric Theorem are already implemented in lean4?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. But some of them will be implemented in far more generality than you need, and you will have to understand the difference between things like angles and oriented angles, and whether you are working mod pi or mod 2pi etc. This kind of geometry is more subtle than how it is usually presented to schoolkids and Lean will keep you honest. </p>\n<p>If you want some concrete goals, then try <em>stating</em> the question which you want to solve. Use the linked file to help you set up the basics.</p>",
