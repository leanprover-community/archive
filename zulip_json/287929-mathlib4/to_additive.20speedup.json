I addressed these issues in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/3632\">!4#3632</a> (with the help of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306601\">@Kyle Miller</span>). This should speed up <code>to_additive</code> significantly, probably by 10x or more. For one of the slowest declarations for <code>to_additive</code> the speedup is 150x.</p>",
