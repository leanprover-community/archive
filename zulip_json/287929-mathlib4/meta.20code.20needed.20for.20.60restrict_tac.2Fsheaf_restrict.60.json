Then, in this file, when <code>f</code> is a section of the structure sheaf of a scheme on an open <code>U</code>, the tactic <code>restrict_tac</code> is not able to see that the basic open where f is invertible is contained in <code>U</code>, even though the lemma <code>Scheme.basicOpen_le</code> is properly tagged as <code>sheaf_restrict</code>.</p>",
