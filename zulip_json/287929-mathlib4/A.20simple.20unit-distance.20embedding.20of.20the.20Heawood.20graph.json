From your commit that is linked in the pr description it is not quite clear to me if you used the same or a similar method or not. <br>\nThe system it underdetermined, therefore I added the symmetry constraint and one additional constraint (x[3] + x[5]). Then I used mpmath's <code>findroot</code> to get many digits of a numerical solution (where in this case probably 37 decimal digits suffice). Next I used pslq (<code>algdep</code>) to get the minimal polynomials and then checked  with exact arithmetic in the field of of algebraic real numbers (<code>AA</code>). I'd gladly re-write the code for this in a somewhat clean way if anybody is interested.</p>\n<p>In any case, I do suspect that there might be <em>faithful</em> embedding of degree lower than 21, and it would be nice to see it, hence the mathoverflow question.</p>",
