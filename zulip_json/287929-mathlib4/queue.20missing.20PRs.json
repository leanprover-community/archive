(They were submitted 3 hours ago, passed CI 30 minutes later, but did not appear.) Re-running some CI job on one of them made both appear. I do not know why.<br>\nThese are not the only ones.</p>\n<p>Removing the \"status:success\" from the search query shows the PR, so the issue really seems to be about github not noticing that CI had passed. Was there a github outage some time ago?</p>",
