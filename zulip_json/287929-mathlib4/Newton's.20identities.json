This PR addresses an item on the list of undergraduate mathematics missing from mathlib, namely Newton's identities on the ring of symmetric polynomials. As I started learning Lean about two weeks ago, there is likely ample room for improvement. Comments on style and simplification of the proof are deeply appreciated. Thanks all!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6112\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6112</a></p>",
