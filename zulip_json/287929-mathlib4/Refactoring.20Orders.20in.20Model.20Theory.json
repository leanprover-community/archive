I've got the first part of it, showing that the age of such a structure is the set of finite linear orders, at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/dlo_age\">branch#dlo_age</a><br>\nIn order to do this, I've had to refactor a whole bunch of the file on orders in model theory, and in particular there are a lot of weird instances and local instances. I'll hopefully isolate a PRs about just the refactor soon, but before I get there, I figured I'd share the project as it is, to see if anyone has any comments.</p>",
