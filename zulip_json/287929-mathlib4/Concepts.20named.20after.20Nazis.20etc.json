I want to start with non-mathematical scholars, because if my idea has merit at all, I think it works better with names of mathematical entities.</p>\n<p>I'm one of those who has sympathy to the idea of restricting honors to people who've done bad things, while also thinking that there are wonderful things worth celebrating by some of those people.  Lately I've wondered whether it would be possible to celebrate a person's beneficial research, and name it as theirs, <em>without celebrating the person as a whole</em>.  The idea would be that rather than naming something <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-54138247\">\"David Hume Tower\"</a>, name  it \"Hume's Epistemology Tower\".  I know, that doesn't roll off the tongue.  And some arguments for renaming might still apply.</p>\n<p>In math I feel that it's easier to think of a theorem as something that goes beyond any person who proved it (especially for those who have Platonistic tendencies to view theorems as discovered rather than created).  A theorem is a very specific, relatively discrete piece of work, even if proving it or understanding it requires knowing and thinking through a lot of other things. </p>\n<p>So whether or not we should start naming things \"Hume's Epistemology Tower\" or \"Ronald A. Fisher's Genetical Theory of Natural Selection Library\", perhaps it's reasonable to think of a named theorem or other mathematical object as celebrating some specific work that contributed to others' understanding of the mathematical entity, rather than celebrating the person as a whole.  In which case maybe there's less reason to remove well-known names for theorems, etc.  (Putting aside <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law_of_eponymy\">Stigler's law of eponymy</a>, alluded to above).</p>",

Having the name in the docstring for searchability is I think a bit of a non-negotiability.
