We require that the topology (and uniformity) of the space is defined by the distance. In particular, points with distance <code>∞</code> from every other point must be isolated points.</p>\n<p>I think this is highly undesirable in practice. For example, <code>ℝ≥0∞</code> is not an <code>EMetricSpace</code>, since <code>∞</code> is not an isolated point. In fact, we have <strong>no</strong> instances of <code>PseudoEMetricSpace</code> besides instances that come from <code>PseudoMetricSpace</code> or instances that already assume <code>(Pseudo)EMetricSpace</code> on some other type.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how to best \"fix\" this. Presumably there's a bunch of lemmas that require <code>EMetricSpace</code> and talk about the topology of the space? (If not, we can simply remove the uniformity from the data of an <code>EMetricSpace</code>.)<br>\nI would like <code>ℝ≥0∞</code> to be an <code>EMetricSpace</code> (if it isn't, then what is?), but I think it cannot be equipped with a nice uniformity? If so, then we should just remove the uniformity from <code>EMetricSpace</code>. However, we want it to work well with the topology (I think), so maybe we should redefine <code>PseudoEMetricSpace</code> to include an axiom that the topology plays well with <code>edist</code>
