Up until that point the mere <em>definition</em> of a <code>MetricSpace</code> happened on line number 2895(!!) of that file. Now it's the first declaration.</p>\n<p>But there's lots more that could be done here. For example, in <code>PseudoMetric</code> we have imports </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.Order.Compact</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib.Topology.Bornology.Constructions</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>neither of which are needed until after line 1000 of that file.</p>\n<p>Lower down in the Mathlib hierarchy we often have a split between <code>X.Defs</code> and <code>X.Basic</code> files, where the <code>.Defs</code> files attempt to do the bare minimum of theory required to set up the definitions, postponing everything else to <code>.Basic</code>.  Here, for example, is the import hierarchy up to <code>Algebra.Field.Defs</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/kSP4ERRzV3vbMViabbzpeVWa/o.png\">o.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/kSP4ERRzV3vbMViabbzpeVWa/o.png\" title=\"o.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/kSP4ERRzV3vbMViabbzpeVWa/o.png\"></a></div><p>Std does this much more systematically, although there the split is called <code>.Basic</code> and <code>.Lemmas</code>. As this gets done more consistently, the <code>.Defs</code> files only need to depend on other <code>.Defs</code> files, and we considerably reduce the import path to the actual definition --- and I think this is a really good thing!</p>\n<p>In <code>PseudoMetric</code> we could certainly do exactly this: those imports I mentioned don't need to be in the <code>.Defs</code> file. But this happens essentially everywhere in Mathlib still.</p>",

Up until that point the mere <em>definition</em> of a <code>MetricSpace</code> happened on line number 2895(!!) of that file. Now it's the first declaration.</p>\n<p>But there's lots more that could be done here. For example, in <code>PseudoMetric</code> we have imports </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.Order.Compact</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib.Topology.Bornology.Constructions</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>neither of which are needed until after line 1000 of that file.</p>\n<p>Lower down in the Mathlib hierarchy we often have a split between <code>X.Defs</code> and <code>X.Basic</code> files, where the <code>.Defs</code> files attempt to do the bare minimum of theory required to set up the definitions, postponing everything else to <code>.Basic</code>.  Here, for example, is the import hierarchy up to <code>Algebra.Field.Defs</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/kSP4ERRzV3vbMViabbzpeVWa/o.png\">o.png</a></p>\n<p>Std does this much more systematically, although there the split is called <code>.Basic</code> and <code>.Lemmas</code>. As this gets done more consistently, the <code>.Defs</code> files only need to depend on other <code>.Defs</code> files, and we considerably reduce the import path to the actual definition --- and I think this is a really good thing!</p>\n<p>In <code>PseudoMetric</code> we could certainly do exactly this: those imports I mentioned don't need to be in the <code>.Defs</code> file. But this happens essentially everywhere in Mathlib still.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FWIW, I just prototyped splitting <code>PseudoMetric</code> as described, it's at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/MR-pseudometric-split-compactness\">branch#MR-pseudometric-split-compactness</a>. Eyes on the split are very welcome.</p>",
