I am new to the community and have a question regarding the current stage of formalization in Elementary Geometry: </p>\n<p>I wonder why some important theorems in Elementary Geometry (eg. <strong>Ceva's theorem</strong> and <strong>Menelaus's theorem</strong>) haven't been formalized so far? Is it because we currently intend to give priority to formalizing the theorems which are more mathematically general or we've met some severe barriers to overcome first in order to progress at the stage? If it is the latter case, could anyone specify what those barriers are? Thanks!!!</p>",
