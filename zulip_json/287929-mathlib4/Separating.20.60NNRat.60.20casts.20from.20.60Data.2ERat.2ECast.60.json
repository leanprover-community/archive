I was wondering if it would make sense to create a new, parallel directory <code>Data.NNRat.Cast</code>?  This would create a dedicated and discoverable home for all the results about <code>NNRat</code> casts, while allowing <code>Data.Rat.Cast</code> to be focused solely on <code>Rat</code>.</p>\n<p>Is this a sensible refactor, or is there a reason for the current mixed structure that I might be overlooking?</p>",
