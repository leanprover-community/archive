I guess in Lean 3, when you wrote <code>Primrec</code> when only <code>Nat.Primrec</code> was open, it would refer to <code>Primrec</code> from the root namespace, but now, <code>Primrec</code> refers to <code>Nat.Primrec</code>, and we need to write <code>_root_.Primrec</code> to explicitly refer to the root.</p>\n<p>Does this indicate that some renaming is in order, or is writing <code>_root_.Primrec</code> everywhere in that namespace OK?</p>",
