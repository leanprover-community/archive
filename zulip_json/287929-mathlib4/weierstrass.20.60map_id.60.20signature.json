Currently its statement uses <code>Algebra.ofId F F</code> to denote the identity <code>AlgHom</code> from <code>F</code> to itself over itself. However, i have a usecase where i need a weaker(?) version, as in my case i'd like to use <code>AlgHom.id R F</code>. These all use the same underlying functions, however they are different enough to the point that <code>rw</code> doesn't like using one in when another could be used. i am tempted to change <code>map_id</code> to use <code>AlgHom.id S F</code> (where there is <code>IsScalarTower R S F</code>). This at least proves the statement in the same generality as <code>map</code> is defined, and as such allows <code>map W (AlgHom.id R F) P = P</code>, <code>map W (AlgHom.id F F) P = P</code> to be proven using <code>rw</code>. However, this no longer allows <code>rw</code> to prove the orignal statement(!!)...</p>\n<p>I'm more than happy to make a PR changing the statement to using <code>AlgHom.id S F</code> (i'm a buttonclick away), however just in case someone has an opinion on this i thought it would be good to ask for opinions...</p>",
