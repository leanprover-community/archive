I'll repeat some of my comment on that PR here:</p>\n<p>I believe the consensus from a long-ago porting meeting was that the PR introduced too much infrastructure, that the stopgap behavior (using <code>solve_by_elim</code>) was ok, and that we had another tactic (which I now forget) to handle some specific cases anyway.</p>\n<p>However,  <code>mono</code> is still just using that stopgap behavior. There's currently no distinction between <code>mono</code> and <code>mono*</code>, and it actually throws errors upon seeing <code>left</code>/<code>right</code>/<code>both</code>, <code>with</code>, and <code>using</code> syntax.</p>\n<p>Now that we're post-port, I feel like there's an argument to be made for intentionally abandoning or modifying some of the syntax:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>mono ... with</code> was essentially an artifact of <code>mono</code>'s bespoke backtracking procedure.</li>\n<li><code>using</code> could still be supported in spirit, and perhaps pass lemmas to a <code>solve_by_elim</code> or <code>aesop</code> call.</li>\n<li><code>left</code> and <code>right</code> could be useful to someone, and it maybe makes sense to have some way to distinguish between different sorts of lemmas based on strictness, but I'm not sure calling them \"left\" and \"right\" is really a clear, understandable abstraction. Also, <code>mono left</code> and <code>mono right</code> seem pretty infrequent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What should we do with <code>mono</code>? Relevant questions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should we simply jettison all other syntax and make the current behavior the only behavior?</li>\n<li>Should we switch to <code>aesop</code> instead of <code>solve_by_elim</code>?</li>\n<li>Should we make an effort to improve the API and provide something instead of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> to distinguish between <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=mul_lt_mul#doc\">docs#mul_lt_mul</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=mul_lt_mul%27%3F#doc\">docs#mul_lt_mul'?</a></li>\n<li>Or should we even still try to port the lean 3 version with some modifications, such as giving <code>mono</code> single-step behavior and preserving <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>using</code> behavior?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I feel the best choice to make is the one preferred by users of <code>mono</code>. I'm not a user of <code>mono</code>, so I can't really give an opinion here.</p>\n<p>How do people feel?</p>",
