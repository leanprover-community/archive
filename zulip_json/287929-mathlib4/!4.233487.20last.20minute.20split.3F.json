This PR has many errors, and after doing a quick pass many don't look easy.</p>\n<p>However I realised, and checked in mathlib3, that Adam's two files actually only depend on the very first part of this file, and in fact as of today we have cleared the errors in that section.</p>\n<p>Thus, I propose we do a later-than-last-minute split of <code>topology.category.Top.limits</code> into smaller pieces (this was overdue in any case, the file is too big, and why did the topological KÃ¶nig lemma not get its own file in the first place?).</p>\n<p>We will then mostly throw out the parts of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/3487\">!4#3487</a> that port past that point, and restart them as needed.</p>\n<p>This will immediately unblock progress on the requirements for the Copenhagen workshop.</p>",
