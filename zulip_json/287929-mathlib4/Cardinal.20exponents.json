I believe in Lean 3, the <code>^</code> symbol was tied to some stronger typeclass we couldn't use, but this isn't an issue anymore in Lean 4.<br>\nb) What's up with <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Cardinal.powerlt#doc\">docs#Cardinal.powerlt</a> ? I'm not asking to get rid of it or anything, but I'm curious to what it's used for or what it was meant for.</p>",
