I’ve seen some work on formalizing the consistency of ZF in Lean, which made me wonder: is it possible, in principle, to formalize Gödel’s incompleteness theorems in Lean? Specifically, can the necessary components such as encoding of syntax, arithmetization of syntax, and fixed-point constructions (like the statement “sub(n, n, 17)”) be implemented in Lean’s framework? I'd appreciate insights on whether this has been done or what the main theoretical challenges are.</p>",
