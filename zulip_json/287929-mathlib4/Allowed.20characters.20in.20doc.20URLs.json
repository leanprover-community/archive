That URL has commas, and docgen splits URLs at such characters. I opened <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/32556\">#32556</a> to replace them with ASCII escapes, but got told that I should be discussed on Zulip.</p>\n<p>Personally I do believe splitting at punctuation marks makes more sense than not (since otherwise writing <a href=\"https://example.com\">https://example.com</a>, would then lead to an incorrect link). Wonder what others think.</p>",
