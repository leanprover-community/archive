My forum nickname, when translated into Chinese, should be “傅醴柯.” “傅” is a common Chinese surname meaning “to teach” or “master.” “醴” means “sweet wine,” and “柯” refers to an “axe handle” or the stem of a plant—a naming motif found across cultures, where natural elements are often used in personal names. But when transliterated into English, it comes off as somewhat ungrammatical. “Nick” can still work as a name, but “Adfor” is entirely non-existent—I made it up as a playful reference to a “+4” joke.</p>\n<p>That said, I still believe that as long as we understand each other or the translator is good enough, anything goes. I remember I even messed up the spelling of \"addictive number theory\" once, but everyone still knew what I meant. It just takes a little communication, a few jokes, and some correction to get by.</p>",
