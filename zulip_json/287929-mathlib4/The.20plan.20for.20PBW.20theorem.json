We have been thinking about the formalization of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for a while, and some preparations on Filtered ring/algebra and associated graded ring/algebra are recently being PRed to mathlib and is still under review.</p>\n<p>But there are several questions that still confuse me while we prepare for the formalization, and I would really like to get some suggestions from here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>How general should we attempt to state the result, and what proof should we follow? Some of the proofs we've been looking at are: (1) the classical proof from Humphrey's book about Lie Algebra, which proves the theorem when the coefficient ring R is a field; (2)<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021869369900866\">A later proof by P.J Higgins</a>, which showed that the result holds when R is a Dedekind domain or the lie algebra is a free module and several other cases... (I came across this proof on MathOverflow)<br>\nBoth proofs are not very easy to formalize as they involve a lot of concrete calculations, the second one is a longer proof and introduces some algebraic structures that I'm not sure whether we want that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are there any general suggestions on how we can decompose the task to collaborate better? It sure seems like (to me) a relatively large thing to formalize, so I think smoother collaboration will be very helpful to the project.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks for your suggestions in advance!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Regarding your question 1, even PBW with just field coefficients would be great, and a very welcome addition to the library.</p>\n<p>Regarding how generally to work the following are the factors that I tend to bear in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applications of the result. What generality do you need to cover them all? Even if they are covered, can you make life easier for downstream users by weakening / dropping an assumption? (E.g., we proved Engel's theorem quite generally and this obviates the need to assume field coefficients for a host of downstream results.)</li>\n<li>Ancillary benefits to Mathlib. Will the extra work require developing theory which will be valuable its own right. (E.g., we have some results for Lie modules under some Artinian + Noetherian assumptions. This is quite ridiculous from the POV of Lie theory but did force us to fill in some API for Artinian / Noetherian modules which should benefit people doing commutative algebra.)</li>\n<li>Personal appetite / curiosity. Sometimes one is just curious about generality.</li>\n<li>Effort required. Often I'm happy to do maybe 2x or 3x the work even for a smallish win in terms of generality but I'd need a big win to justify 10x or more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's always a bit of a guess though: for PBW I can't really give great answers to these so I'll just repeat my remark that even just field coefficients would be great.</p>",

Making a good blueprint is a huge amount of work though.</p>\n<p>There is also the possibility to use a GitHub Project. Again making a good project is a huge amount of work but even a very tiny one can be valuable. E.g., before I got pulled into other work, I spent about two hours setting <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/leanprover-community/projects/17\">one up last year</a> and it has certainly paid me back multiples of the time I took to create it in terms of contributors.</p>",
