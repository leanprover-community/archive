When responding to the questions you posed above, the primary things I considered were: dot notation, is it okay for this to be in the root namespace or is it to specialized?, and does it otherwise follow the naming conventions given in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html\">#naming</a> ? Another question is: will it cause naming conflicts if it's in the root namespace (also relevant for determining whether a namespaced declaration should be <code>protected</code>)?</p>",
