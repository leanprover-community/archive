I plan to create a folder <code>Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Function/AbsolutelyContinuous</code> with files like <code>Basic.lean</code> etc. The integral part will probably be in a file like <code>AbsCont.lean</code> in the existing folder <code>Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/IntervalIntegral</code>.</p>",
