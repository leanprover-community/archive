However, the expected green checkmark symbol didn't appear, which means there was no feedback on the execution result. I have confirmed that the Lean4 extension in VS Code has been correctly installed, and all relevant dependencies have also been set up properly.</p>\n<p>I have tried restarting VS Code, and even reinstalling the Lean4 extension and the related environment, but the problem still persists. Currently, I'm not sure whether there is a logical error in the code or there are some omissions in the environment configuration.</p>",
