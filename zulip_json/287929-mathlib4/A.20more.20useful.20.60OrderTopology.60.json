        "content": "<p>Right now, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=OrderTopology#doc\">docs#OrderTopology</a> says that a topology is the least topology with the opens <code>Set.Ioo a b</code>. I would like to propose changing this to say that it is least topology with the <em>closed</em> sets <code>Set.Icc a b</code>. For linear orders, these are equivalent, and as far I can tell this accounts for like &gt;90% of theorems involving OrderTopology.</p>\n<p>But for sets that aren't totally ordered, I claim that the latter is much more useful (and holds true on many more objects of interest). For instance, take ℝ × ℝ under the pointwise product order (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Basic.html#Prod.instPartialOrder\">Prod.instPartialOrder</a>). Now the interval <code>Set.Ioo (ax,ay) (bx,by)</code> is the set <code>((Set.Icc ax bx) ×' (Set.Icc ay by)) \\ {(ax,ay), (bx,by)}</code>; it's a square in the plane, that is closed everywhere except for the bottom-left/top-right corners, where there's a single point missing. This is a relatively awkward set (to me), and isn't closed.</p>\n<p>But under this pointwise product ordering, products of closed sets are closed sets, so this works out nicely. The same is true for pi-types (infinitary products). Similar nice things typically work out in many lattices, majorization order, etc. I bumped into this recently when I was looking at operators in a C*-algebra under the spectral order, where again the closed intervals define the topology, but the open intervals are ugly.</p>",
