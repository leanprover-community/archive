The proof of both Mason-Stothers and polynomial FLT are elementary, and a full Lean 3 formalization exists, so it shouldn't take that long if one decides to actually port it.</p>\n<p>So the questions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will it be good for mathlib4 to have this theorem? Have a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/seewoo5/lean-poly-abc\">Lean 3 project readme</a> to get a feeling of what the theorem is.</li>\n<li>If so, how can we (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"242240\">@Jineon Baek</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"588998\">@Seewoo Lee</span>) start? Should we start by using mathport to convert our Lean 3 project?</li>\n</ul>",

And also note that their common multiples are also solutions to FLT (the non-coprime solutions).</p>\n<p>The question is whether we should a suitable statement of FLT for general semiring that can accommodate this, or should we treat polynomial FLT as a separate theorem. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A common statement that works is: if a, b, c satisfies <code>a^n+b^n=c^n</code> then a, b, c are common multiples of units.
