However, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Set/Insert.html#Set.subset_insert_iff\"><code>Set.subset_insert_iff</code></a> states that s <code>s ⊆ insert x t ↔ s ⊆ t ∨ x ∈ s ∧ s \\ {x} ⊆ t</code>. I think this naming is confusing because I thought it should be same (or similar) statement (and maybe, there's no similar Finset's statement for Set), and perhaps, it doesn't seem to be following mathlib's naming convention. I thought these should be renamed, how about?</p>",
