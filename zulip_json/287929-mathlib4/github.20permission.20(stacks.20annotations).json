The teachers can teach them commutative algebra before they begin formalizing.</p>\n<p>Since we are most interested in algebra, maybe beginning with \"Chapter 9: Fields\" is a good start and then we can try to progress towards \"Chapter 10: Commutative Algebra\". A (maybe stubborn) working method is to check one by one whether a theorem in the Stacks Project is already formalized in mathlib. If yes, we add the corresponding Stacks Project tag to the comments of the formal theorem (or its formal variant). If not, we try to formalize and add this theorem into Mathlib. If the theorem is too early to be formalized yet, we may leave it as a TODO.</p>\n<p>I hold the belief that \"every theorem in the stacks project should be formalized (possibly in a variant form) into Mathlib\". Do you have any suggestions and comments on this project? Thank you!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The WIP PRs are <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16105\">#16105</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16116\">#16116</a>.</p>",
