So far so good. But then somebody added a lemma somewhere else to simplify one of my proofs, which was great ! This lemma was PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9137\">#9137</a> and quickly got merged.  I didn't want to keep that lemma in the wrong place in my PR, so I thought that it would be a good idea to update the copy of mathlib in my branch, and I tried to use the new <code>∀</code> menu in vscode and clicked \"project actions -&gt; update dependency\", and, well my files don't build anymore and I get this wonderful error message:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"

I guess you're not supposed to update a mathlib branch the same way as a project using mathlib as a dependency (in retrospect, I guess strictly speaking mathlib is not a dependency here, so I should have expected it); I did test the  <code>∀</code> menu method on one of my regular projects just after and it worked fine. But then my questions are:<br>\n(1) Was there any way for me to get the new lemmas ? (Maybe that's actually a git question. I am not super comfortable with git as soon as I leave the basic git pull/commit/push world.)<br>\n(2) Is there a way to recover from this, or should I just scratch the PR and create a new one ?</p>",
