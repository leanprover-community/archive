As <code>refine'</code> seems to be present in various files, is there an easy way for me to write some code that automatically replaces <code>refine'</code> by <code>refine</code> on various files and make a PR with this? I'm still working through the meta-programming book, so I'm not yet at the point that I can write this up myself, but I'm happy to learn! Otherwise, I'll circle back to this once I've worked through the meta-programming book!</p>",
