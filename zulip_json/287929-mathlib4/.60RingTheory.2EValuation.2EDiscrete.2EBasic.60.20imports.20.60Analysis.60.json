These results are contained in <code>Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.Discrete.Basic</code>. However it seems that <code>Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.Discrete.Basic</code> imports some file from <code>Mathlib.Analysis</code> and this is not allowed by the linter (as a cross-directory import). How best to fix this issue? I can think of either moving the results about <code>IsDiscreteValuationRing</code> to another file (but I am not sure if these results actually do require <code>Mathlib.Analysis</code>), or adding this as an exception to <code>overrideAllowedImportDirs</code>,  but I am not sure what is the 'right' way to address this.</p>",
