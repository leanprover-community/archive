        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306577\">@Matthew Ballard</span>, you asked in the community meeting today what would happen if we asked Claude code to give us improved documentation. </p>\n<p>I made <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/23964\">#23964</a> by selecting 5 missing documentations in <code>nolints.json</code> and asking Cursor to document them. I would be curious to know what you or others think of what it provided. I have done one or two PRs trying to fix docs linter tech debt. Frankly , as far as I can tell, the documentation in this PR is fine, possibly better than what I would have produced if I tried to fix these myself. (I didn't change any of the text, I only fixed some line length violations, the AI it used under the hood is apparently Claude 3.5 sonnet).</p>",
