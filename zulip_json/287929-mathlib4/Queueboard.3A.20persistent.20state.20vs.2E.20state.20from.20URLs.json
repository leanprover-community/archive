With the brand-new change to allow table configuration from URL state (<a href=\"https://github.com/jcommelin/queueboard/pull/65\">queueboard#65</a>; announcement coming soon), this seems to run into a conflict. In local testing, I have certainly observed weird behaviour (of search parameters not being respected) which disappeared when the option was removed.</p>\n<p>I can write more details tomorrow. For now, I just wanted to ask: if you could set the \"entries per page\" selectors via an URL parameter, is stickiness still important/required for you?</p>",
