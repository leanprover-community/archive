But when I tried to add an example of how to use it to the file, I couldn't think of a RHS that didn't look alien. Specifically:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"sd\">/-- If 𝔽 is a field, 𝔽^n is a vector space over 𝔽. -/</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">example</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">𝔽</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">Field</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">𝔽</span><span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">VectorSpace</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">𝔽</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Fin</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">𝔽</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">{}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I got that <code>{}</code> from <code>exact?</code>, and I guess I follow what it means, it's saying \"all the data for a vector space is already inferred from the typeclass system finding those 3 other type classes\" -- but it .. looks weird doesn't it? I tried putting <code>infer_instance</code> there instead, and Lean tells me vector space indeed isn't a class (which I guess the docs for <code>variable_alias</code> also tell me). I'm re-reading the docs as I'd only skimmed them before, but is there something obviously clearer to put there?</p>",
