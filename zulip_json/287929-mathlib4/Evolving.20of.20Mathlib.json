I'm wondering about the changes. I was told that there are more than 200k theorems in the library now, but when I was testing previously, the statistics showed around 130k.</p>\n<p>I want to know where I can find these numbers and new statistics for the newer version of Mathlib. Thanks for your help!</p>",
