Under the <a href=\"https://github.com/lucasvreis/BirkhoffErgodicThm/tree/main/BirkhoffErgodicThm\">library folder</a>, there are three files with some results that I think should go into other existing files in mathlib.

But note that this is already in Mathlib, in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MeasurableSpace.invariants#doc\">docs#MeasurableSpace.invariants</a> (with a small API around it).</li>\n<li>The most efficient way is indeed to PR one file at a time, because it's much easier for reviewers (and also you will learn some tricks along the process, so later PRs will be smoother).</li>\n<li>Indeed, typeclasses will need to be generalized in BirkhoffSumPR. <code>linarith</code> shouldn't be relevant -- the assumptions should essentially be the same as in the definition of Birkhoff averages.</li>\n<li>Integrability of the function should indeed be enough, you shouldn't need to assume measurability in addition. However, if it is more convenient for some auxiliary lemmas, you can definitely prove them with the additional assumption, and then drop it in the final version of the interesting results by reducing to the measurable case.</li>\n<li>The basic lemma you mentions already exists, as <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=abs_le_max_abs_abs#doc\">docs#abs_le_max_abs_abs</a> (I found it just by doing <code>by exact?</code> on your lemma).</li>\n</ul>",

It seems the easiest way is to drop it in the final version of the theorem, because some theorem related to restriction of measures requires strict measurability of some sets. Before travelling I attempted to drop the assumption everywhere and got stuck. I can't remember which one it was right now and I'm still away from the desktop computer in which the attempt was made.</p>",
