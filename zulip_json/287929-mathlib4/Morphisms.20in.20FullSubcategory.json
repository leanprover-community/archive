Anne's work is complete, so now would be a good time to try again. This is on my TODO list and I will get to it eventually but of course I'd be very happy if someone else does it. Based on the experience at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/induced-struct\">branch#induced-struct</a>, it shouldn't be too hard to finish the refactor.</p>",
