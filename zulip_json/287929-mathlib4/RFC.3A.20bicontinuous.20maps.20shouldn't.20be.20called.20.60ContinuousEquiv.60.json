        "content": "<p>We are taught as mathematics undergraduates that a continuous bijection between topological spaces might not have a continuous inverse, and the special word \"homeomorphism\" is used for a continuous bijection which does happen to have a continuous inverse. Mathlib has translated this to <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Homeomorph#doc\">docs#Homeomorph</a> , a reasonable choice given that this is (at least most of the letters of) what the word is in English. But <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=ContinuousLinearEquiv#doc\">docs#ContinuousLinearEquiv</a> has always bothered me a little, because (for the same reasons) it's not a linear isomorphism which is also continuous, it's an isomorphism in the category of topological algebraic objects, i.e. a continuous linear bijection with continuous linear inverse. It has just occurred to me that we could change the name of this declaration to <code>BicontinuousLinearEquiv</code> and all of a sudden the ambiguity is resolved, because \"bicontinuous map\" is another word for \"homeomorphism\". Mathlib has just added <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=ContinuousMulEquiv#doc\">docs#ContinuousMulEquiv</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=ContinuousAddEquiv#doc\">docs#ContinuousAddEquiv</a> a few days ago and my comments also apply to these declarations; I think there's a reasonable argument that they should be called <code>BicontinuousMulEquiv</code> etc. I started thinking about this because we have <code>ContinuousAlgEquiv</code> in FLT and it irked me when merging it that it wasn't a continuous algebra equivalence. <code>ContinuousAffineEquiv</code> also suffers from the same problem. Do you think we should change all of them or am I fussing about nothing?</p>",
