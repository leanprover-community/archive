        "content": "<p>I think this is because <code>succAbove_ne_last_last</code> (unapplied) is still a simp lemma, and so Lean tries to apply it in the forward direction, which makes the <code>a ≠ a.succAbove (last n)</code> side-goal appear. And now, unlike before, that side-goal is closable, so the forward rewrite succeeds. But the backwards rewrite from the applied version of that lemma also succeeds, creating a loop.
