This is why you often see ℤ/nℤ described as \"the numbers from 0 to n - 1\", or why a group theory argument might start with \"take an element out of each coset\". We just find it easier to think of a single element, rather than a whole family of elements with some common property.</p>\n<p>The same often happens to ordinals. Be it for technical or didactical reasons, one often defines an ordinal as a transitive ZFC set, well-ordered under membership. And that ensures that every ordinal corresponds to a single \"canonical\" linear order.</p>\n<p>But I'd argue the benefit of doing this, at least within Lean's theory, is quite slim. By the point you're defining addition, you have to contend that <code>x + y</code> isn't really the lexicographic sum of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, but rather whichever ordinal that's isomorphic to it. And something similar ends up happening with all of the other arithmetic operations. Your initial choice of representative ends up not mattering at all.</p>",
