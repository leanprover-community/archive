        "content": "<p>I noticed that Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Eigenspace/Basic.lean contains explicit references to Sheldon Axler's linear algebra textbook.  I found that very helpful, because I can read Axler's book and quickly get an idea about the overall shape of the formalization.  On the other hand, the textbook from which I learned my algebra (Artin) does not talk about monoids and mentions semigroups only in a few exercises.  So the way that group theory is developed in Mathlib is unfamiliar to me and I would find it very helpful if I can read an informal math document that develops group theory in this fashion.  Hence my question: are there references to the informal math literature on which the various parts of Mathlib are based closely or even roughly?</p>",
