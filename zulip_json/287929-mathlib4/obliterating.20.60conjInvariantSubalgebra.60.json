I thought it was only used in Stone-Weierstrass, but I realized you also had it for <code>Fourier.AddCircle</code>, which I assumed was just to use Stone-Weierstrass, right? Do you have any qualms about getting rid of <code>conjInvariantSubalgebra</code>? The <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=fourierSubalgebra#doc\">docs#fourierSubalgebra</a> seems to work perfectly well as a <code>StarSubalgebra</code> instead.</p>",
