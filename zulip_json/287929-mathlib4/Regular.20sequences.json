I don't have a particular roadmap in mind yet. Next steps after cleaning up and merging what I've done so far are to define depth and the koszul complex, and to prove depth sensitivity of the koszul complex. I'd welcome any comments on the commit above or general thoughts on how this cluster of commutative algebra should be implemented.</p>\n<p>One thing I want to note is that mathlib generally tries to work in high generality, but regular sequences are really not well behaved outside of noetherian local rings. While regularity is defined in mathlib for just a monoid, I couldn't find anything satisfying in the literature about regular sequences even over commutative semirings, and so have elected to define it only for commutative rings. In the non local and non Noetherian cases there's a chain of notions of regularity: regular sequence =&gt; weakly regular sequence =&gt; koszul-regular sequence =&gt; H1-regular sequence =&gt; quasi-regular sequence. These all coincide for a sequence in the maximal ideal of a Noetherian local ring. At the moment I've defined the first two of these. I don't know if it's worth spending time defining the rest of them at the moment. But I'll certainly be using the notion of a Koszul-regular sequence even in the Noetherian local case, and probably quasi-regular sequences, even if unnamed. So it's maybe worth defining all these regularity conditions now? But I'm worried about getting bogged down in this and not doing any of the fun commutative algebra :)</p>\n<p>Edit: Also, a lot of stuff about depth and regular sequences have a graded analogue which is also quite useful. I'm not sure if it makes sense to do this in parallel, delay it until it's needed, or use some common abstraction that's been worked out (which I'm not familiar with). </p>\n<p>Again, I'd love to hear others' input on this stuff</p>",
