Pinging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"481133\">@Alex Keizer</span>, as they've been looking at it. Hopefully it is just a matter of addressing Eric's comments. </p>\n<p>I'm about to go release v4.3.0 and then v4.4.0-rc1, and so this PR will soon be blocking upgrading Mathlib.</p>",
