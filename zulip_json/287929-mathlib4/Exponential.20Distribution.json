I noticed there is no exponential distribution in Mathlib.Probability.Distributions, so I  thought it would be a good first contribution to Mathlib4. Is there anything I should be aware of as a first-time contributor?</p>\n<p>I'm planning to follow the structure of Mathlib.Probability.Distributions.Gaussian.Real. The scope I have in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define the PDF and the measure via withDensity</li>\n<li>Prove it's a probability measure</li>\n<li>Prove basic properties (mean, variance, MGF, memoryless property, CDF)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I've already done most of this as a personal exercise, so I have working proofs to start from.</p>",
