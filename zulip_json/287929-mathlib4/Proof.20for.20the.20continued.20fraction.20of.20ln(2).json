        "content": "<p>Congrats on formalizing the proof of an interesting formula! (or teaching Aristotle to do so, which is still great)</p>\n<p>I am a bit confused by all the repeating theorem with <code>_final</code>, <code>_v2</code>, <code>_main</code>, though. When doing a quick review of the proof, people likely want to check the statement first, so you should point out which is the main theorem. Here the last one <code>limit_of_sum_term</code> looks like a different formula from \"continued fraction\", so that added more confusion. I guessed that <code>ln2_cf_converges</code> is the one for continued fraction</p>",
