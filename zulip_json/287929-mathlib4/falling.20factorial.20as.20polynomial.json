Wouldn't it be nice to also have falling factorial as a polynomial? (I need it in a proof currently)</p>\n<p>What would be a good name? I think it might be a good idea to change <code>pochhammer</code> to <code>raisingFactorial</code> and then add <code>fallingFactorial</code>.<br>\nWe already have the corresponding <code>ascFactorial</code> and <code>descFactorial</code> for Nat, so if it is too confusing to call the polynomials <code>raisingFactorial</code> and <code>fallingFactorial</code>, one could also go with <code>ascFactorialPolynomial</code> and <code>descFactorialPolynomial</code> or <code>raisingFactorialPolynomial</code> and <code>fallingFactorialPolynomial</code><br>\nI guess one could also simply go with <code>pochhammer</code> and <code>pochhammer'</code> <br>\n(or even <code>pochhammer</code> and <code>remmahhcop</code>, just kidding)</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",
