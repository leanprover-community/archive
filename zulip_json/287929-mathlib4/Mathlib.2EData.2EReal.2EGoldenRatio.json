Indeed, most of the theory can be generalized to <code>a + \\sqrt{b}</code> for any <code>a b</code>, but <code>goldenRatio</code> (or <code>goldenConj</code>) appears in quite a few math papers on circle dynamics, because it corresponds to a fixed point of <code>x \\mapsto \\{1 / x\\}</code>, which means that you can deal with renormalizations that don't change the roration number. While many (if not all) of these papers can be generalized to maps with rotation number of finite type, I don't think that we should make it even harder to formalize them.</p>",
