My guess is that this is a result of some interplay between new structures (since a <code>LinearIsometryEquiv</code> extends <code>LinearEquiv</code>) and maybe Lean not seeing a term of <code>PiLp</code> as a function (note that the second <code>ext</code> was necessary in order for the <code>LinearEquiv.PiCongrLeft'_symm_apply</code> to apply.</p>",
