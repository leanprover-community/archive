This was changed in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/25614\">#25614</a> because I thought that it was necessary for PRs from forks to be able to merge. However, on thinking about this some more, I think I was wrong about that and we could try reverting the changes to <code>bors.toml</code> again so that the required jobs are all listed individually. </p>\n<p>I'll try and put a PR together later today.</p>",
