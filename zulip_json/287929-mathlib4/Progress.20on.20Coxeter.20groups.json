        "content": "<p>Hello everyone! I am currently at the <a href=\"https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/formalproofslean/\">Workshop on Formal Proofs and Lean</a> at the National University of Singapore.</p>\n<p>In case anyone is curious, here is a summary of the current situation regarding the formalization of the theory of Coxeter groups.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are two separate projects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project A: The project initiated by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"443984\">@Newell Jensen</span> and continued by me. This is aimed at building the basic theory of Coxeter groups. It contains some foundational results about the length function, reduced words, descents, inversions, and the standard geometric representation. Some of this project is already on the master branch of mathlib (see <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/GroupTheory/Coxeter/Basic.html#CoxeterSystem\">here</a>). The rest is contained within the mathlib pull requests <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11406\">#11406</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11465\">#11465</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11466\">#11466</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11526\">#11526</a>. Branch <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/trivial1711-coxeter-groups-all\">mathlib4/trivial1711-coxeter-groups-all</a> contains the contents of all of these pull requests. This project was set up with a view toward Matsumoto's theorem and the classification of finite irreducible Coxeter groups, but it is not actively being worked on.</li>\n<li>Project B: The Xiamen University/National University of Singapore/Renmin University project. This is currently separate from mathlib and can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/NUS-Math-Formalization/coxeter\">here</a>. The team consists primarily of undergraduates and the project is overseen by Professor <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"701607\">@Huanchen Bao</span> at NUS. The primary current goal is to define the Bruhat order on a Coxeter group and to establish the basic properties of Bruhat intervals. There are some other stretch goals, such as the theory of Hecke algebras.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are currently working on making these two projects compatible, and we have decided to do so by refactoring project B to build upon the definitions and theorems from project A. This is a sizable amount of work, but we agreed that project B was in need of a refactor anyway, in part to align it more closely to the conventions of mathlib. The team has been handling this new work very well and making an impressive amount of progress. (Fortunately, much of project B is completely independent from project A, and that part doesn't need to be changed at all.)</p>\n<p>Pull requests <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11406\">#11406</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11465\">#11465</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11466\">#11466</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11526\">#11526</a> are still open. Now, the contents of these pull requests are actively being used, so any feedback on how to make the API friendlier is highly appreciated.</p>\n<p>P.S. Thanks so much, Professor Bao, for inviting me to this workshop. I've been having a great time.</p>",
