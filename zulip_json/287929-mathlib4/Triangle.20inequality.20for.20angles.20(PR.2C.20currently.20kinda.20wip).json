I have currently named it \"UnitSphereAngles\" (which is better than \"TemporaryName\", but not good on its own).<br>\n2) I made definition <code>noncomputable def normalized (x : V) : V := ‖x‖⁻¹ • x</code>. What do you think about its name? (Previously I had it named <code>unit</code> which was understandably rejected.)<br>\n3) Only first three theorems of <code>Normalized.lean</code> file are used in the proof (<code>normalized_zero_eq_zero</code>, <code>norm_normalized_eq_one_iff</code>, <code>normalized_eq_self_of_norm_eq_one</code>), but I probably should add some more results to this file. Maybe you have some suggestions in addition to the existing 5 theorems?</p>\n<p>When all these questions are solved (or maybe even right now) I should work on documentation in these files.</p>",
