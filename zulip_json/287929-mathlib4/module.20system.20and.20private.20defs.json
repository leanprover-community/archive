In <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/34499\">#34499</a>, I have a file with</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AddContent</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">supClosureFun</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AddContent</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">supClosure</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">where</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">toFun</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AddContent</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">supClosureFun</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">properties</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">lemma</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AddContent</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">supClosure_apply</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The precise definition in <code>AddContent.supClosureFun</code> is an implementation detail, that is not useful nor relevant. Downstream, people should never have a need for the function <code>AddContent.supClosureFun</code>, and neither for the precise definition of <code>AddContent.supClosure</code>. The only property they should use is the lemma <code>AddContent.supClosure_apply</code> which says everything there is to know about it.</p>\n<p>I'd like to make the definition <code>AddContent.supClosureFun</code> private, and also say that the implementation of <code>AddContent.supClosure</code> is private, while still making the definition and the lemma available in subsequent files. To me, this looks like a perfect situation for the module system, except that I don't know the right incantations. Could someone confirm that this is the kind of task where the module system shines, and how to do it?</p>",
