The files on the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/index.html\">mathlib library online</a> don't match this older version of mathlib.  I tried to follow the directions here on the splash page of the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4?tab=readme-ov-file#building-html-documentation\">github repo</a>   but <code>lake</code> complains that there isn't a <code>lakefile.lean</code>.  There is a <code>lakefile.toml</code> however.</p>\n<p>So my question is the following: How can i either generate or look at the documentation for the 4.7 version of mathlib?  I appreciate any help.</p>",
