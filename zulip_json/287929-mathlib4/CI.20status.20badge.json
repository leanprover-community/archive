Small investigation suggests that this is due to github not accepting <code>continuous integration</code> as the passed name of the workflow whose status should be displayed. changing it to <code>build.yml</code> seems to fix it.</p>\n<p>Two questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>am i correct in my assesment that these \"workflow nicknames\" are not supposed to be accepted (anymore, possibly)?</li>\n<li>is a PR for this welcome?</li>\n</ul>",
