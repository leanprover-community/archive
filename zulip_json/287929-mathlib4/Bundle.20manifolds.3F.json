I'm unsure what the best way to systematically define categories like that would be though: there are a lot of different categories of manifolds, depending on which restrictions like Hausdorffness, paracompactness, boundarylessness, finite-dimensionality etc. you want to impose. Do we want one category with almost no restrictions, that all the other categories would be full subcategories of? That would probably be closest to a type of bundled manifolds, but I'm unsure how relevant it would be in practice</p>",
