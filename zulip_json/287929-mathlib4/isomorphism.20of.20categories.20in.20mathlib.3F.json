This work suggests that even if we have kind of avoided introducing this notion until now, it would be a good idea to have a Prop typeclass <code>Equivalence.IsIso</code>, and a <code>Equivalence.toEquiv</code> which would allow to obtain bijections between types. By adding a few typeclasses about pre/post-composition with isomorphisms of categories, this should ease certain definitions in this PR.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The specific definitions are no longer included in that PR, so I'm not planning to act on this now. But I thought I'd check whether others agree that this would be useful API to have in Mathlib. If so, does someone want to implement it?</p>",
