This step can be skipped when the declaration is very new (say, less than one week).<br>\nThere is no need to create aliasses for renaming instances. <br>\nFor automatically generated declarations (e.g. by <code>to_additive</code> or <code>simps</code>), please ensure the generated declaration is also tagged with this attribute. </p>\n<p><strong>Removing deprecated items.</strong><br>\nDeprecated items can be removed from mathlib after &lt;time&gt; after their initial deprecation date.
