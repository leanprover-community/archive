The <code>to_dual</code> tactic can't dualize theorems about <code>IsTotal α (· ≤ ·)</code> properly because it avoids writing <code>IsTotal α (· ≥ ·)</code>, instead opting to write <code>IsTotal α fun x y ↦ y ≤ x</code>. This then led us to the question of why even have an <code>IsTotal</code> typeclass instead of just writing <code>IsTotalLE</code>. Such a predicate could then be made its own order dual. Would that be a desirable change?</p>",
