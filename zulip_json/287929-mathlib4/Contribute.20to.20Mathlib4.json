We are working on  formalizing some properties related to the properties of the convex functions and the convergence rate of some classical optimization methods. How should we organize our code so that it meets the relevant requirements of mathlib？How do we upload our written code？Can there be some documentation written with relative requirements? Thank you very much for answering!</p>",
