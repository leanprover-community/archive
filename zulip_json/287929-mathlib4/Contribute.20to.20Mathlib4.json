We are working on  formalizing some properties related to the properties of the convex functions and the convergence rate of some classical optimization methods. How should we organize our code so that it meets the relevant requirements of mathlib？How do we upload our written code？Can there be some documentation written with relative requirements? Thank you very much for answering!</p>",

You should have a look at the whole \"Contributing\" section of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html</a> <br>\nUnfortunately most of the information there is still about Lean3, and I’m not sure we have it updated for Lean4 anywhere, so you’ll have to adapt it a bit based on existing Mathlib4 code.</p>",
