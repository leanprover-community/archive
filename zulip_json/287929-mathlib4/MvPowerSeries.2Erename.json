To achieve this, the plan involves constructing <code>MvPowerSeries.optionEquivLeft</code> to support induction on the number of variables. However, while drafting the proof and referring to the polynomial library, I realized that I first need to implement <code>MvPowerSeries.rename</code>, analogous to what exists in <code>MvPolynomial/rename.lean</code>.</p>\n<p>I have implemented a preliminary version of <code>MvPowerSeries.rename</code>, which is <code>rename.lean</code> in<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/BryceT233/power-series-ring-is-noetherian-\">https://github.com/BryceT233/power-series-ring-is-noetherian-</a></p>\n<p>As this is my first time contribution to Mathlib, any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated! thanks!</p>",
