I come from a bit of an unusual background in medical physics but im applying to math phds right now. I am planning to use this build in my own work and considering ive leveraged mathlib so heavily for my own work I thought it would be useful to ask if this work is desirable for the community..</p>\n<p>Full disclosure, unfortunately as of now I work alone - i have a small company im starting but that being said I use ai heavily. I have checked these statements consistently but I dont want to pretend anything. It is what it is and im just thankful for a community. The github repo CI passes fully without sorry, admit, or axiom.</p>\n<p>Please find the repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/RoyGBivens137/Reusable\">https://github.com/RoyGBivens137/Reusable</a> </p>\n<p>i am happy to improve it as necessary.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nZach</p>",
