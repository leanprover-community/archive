The issue here is that <code>Bundle.of</code> forces partial monomorphization of the universe levels as <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Bundled.of#doc\">docs#Bundled.of</a> only accepts arguments from the same <code>u</code>. </p>\n<p>In multiple situations, we pass from types to a category back to types and then to the category many times. Each pass with <code>Bundled.of</code> creates new universe constraints that Lean needs to solve. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6370\">#6370</a> shows that universe behavior can significantly influence performance. Is this contributing to some of the worst slowdowns we are seeing?</p>",
