The thing is that there is a lot of redundancy in the <code>Cardinal</code>/<code>Ordinal</code> APIs caused by the sole reason that cardinals/ordinals in different universes can't be directly compared; you need to use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Cardinal.lift#doc\">docs#Cardinal.lift</a> or <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Ordinal.lift#doc\">docs#Ordinal.lift</a> to move them to a common universe, then compare them there.</p>",
