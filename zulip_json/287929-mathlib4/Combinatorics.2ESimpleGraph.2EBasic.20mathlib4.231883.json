Following <code>aesop_cat</code>, I have created an <code>aesop_graph</code> tactic as a custom wrapper around <code>aesop</code> for proving graph-theory lemmas. I will not be working on the file for the next several hours since it is night time here, so I am notifying here in case anyone else would like to work on the file in the meantime. It is a fairly big file (around 2000 lines long) which may take a few days to complete.</p>",
