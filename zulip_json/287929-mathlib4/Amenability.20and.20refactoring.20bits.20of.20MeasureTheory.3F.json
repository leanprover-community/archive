        "content": "<p>I'm interested in adding some classical results on group amenability to mathlib4. There are several equivalent formulations, but I would like to include the equivalence of means (functionals on ℓ^∞) and finitely-additive measures (see e.g. Wagon S, <em>The Banach-Tarski Paradox</em>). I think some results are easier when framed in terms of finitely-additive measures. </p>\n<p>I'm able to derive a finitely-additive measure from a mean fairly easily out of the box. But for the other direction, I would like to reuse the Lebesgue integral from MeasureTheory. MeasureTheory is (clearly) concerned with sigma algebras and countably additive measures, and I suppose I could assume DiscreteMeasurableSpace. I also found MeasureTheory.FinMeasAdditive, but I'm not sure it's set up in a useful way for my intended goal.</p>\n<p>Would a reasonable approach be to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add some external \"SimpleFun\" structure that doesn't concern MeasurableSpace specifically, and have MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc extend it.</li>\n<li>define some \"PreMeasure\" typeclass that could be extended both by Measure and other typeclasses with different starting assumptions (perhaps PreMeasure merely requires measureOf)</li>\n<li>extract the definitions and lemmas regarding lintegral that don't make use of countable additivity, and have them rely on \"PreMeasure\" from above?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Am I on the right track? Or would it be better to just copy and modify SimpleFunc, lintegral, and the relevant lemmas?</p>",
