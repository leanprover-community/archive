I've got the file compiling apart from one failing <code>simp</code> proof, where I can't get a rewrite to work because of motive is not type correct issues. I've documented what I know <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/c6afdc64685dfd63af0004fb566235760985212c/Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Sites/CoverLifting.lean#L201-L222\">here</a> but I don't know how to make any more progress. Any help appreciated! If we can get this file working then <code>category_theory.sites.dense_subsite</code>, an explicit target for Copenhagen (and the first thing on the port progress list) is unblocked.</p>",
