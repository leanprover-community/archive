Is it fine to reintroduce such a dependency at this point? Judging by the discussion on that PR and the porting notes it looks like it was a temporary restriction anyways, since some of the proofs were uglified to make that work.<br>\nI'm asking this in the context of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/4691\">#4691</a>, where <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"556717\">@Emilie Uthaiwat</span> adds her main result to <code>RingTheory.Polynomial.Quotient</code> just because it's the first file that has all of the neccessary import, but that feels wrong since this result is not at all about quotients of polynomial rings like the rest of the file.</p>",
