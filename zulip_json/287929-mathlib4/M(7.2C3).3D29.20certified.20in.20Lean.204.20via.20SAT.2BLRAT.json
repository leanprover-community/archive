The Lean proof is sorry-free.</p>\n<p>Exact values for n=1–6 are also fully verified via native_decide and LRAT.</p>\n<p>I'm also working on Erdős Problem 20: <a href=\"https://www.erdosproblems.com/20\">https://www.erdosproblems.com/20</a> (uniform sunflower conjecture) — base cases f(1,3)–f(6,3) are proved, general bound is open.</p>\n<p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/SproutSeeds/sunflower-lean\">https://github.com/SproutSeeds/sunflower-lean</a></p>\n<p>Happy to discuss the SAT encoding, the LRAT bridge approach, or the Erdős 20 framework. Also open to collaborations or formalization commissions if anyone has results they'd like verified.</p>\n<p>The SAT+LRAT verification pipeline in SATBridge.lean is designed to be reusable for other combinatorics certification problems.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>update</em><br>\nAlso posted in #maths &gt; M(7,3)=29 certified in Lean 4 via SAT+LRAT for better channel fit.</p>",
