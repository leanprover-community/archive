It turns out that this averaging process gives you an extension which is the unique one with some properties, so it's definitely worth a name. But I don't like Aut in the name because there's no automorphism in the type of the definition, automorphism just play a role in the definition of the underlying function. What would be a better name for this? Or should I stop fussing?</p>",
