The project entails contributing to one of the open source lean4 libraries. I noticed that there were a lot of \"basic\" graph theorems missing, (or I couldn't find them). Such as Eulers formula (V − E + F = 2) and K_5 and K_{3,3} being non-planar. I also believe that it is not proven that every connected graph has a spanning tree. Graphs interest me so I was wondering how I could best contribute to this field in mathlib (if my BEP supervisor agrees of course). <br>\nAre there any specific suggestions that are recommended I take a look at/attempt?</p>",
