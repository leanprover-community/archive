If we have to prove something like <code>a * (b - Finset.sum ...) = 0</code>, we should be able to do <code>rw [sum_eq_zero]</code>, which should create two goals, firstly that <code>a * (b - 0) = 0</code> and secondly the unspecified assumption to<code>sum_eq_zero</code> which is that all the terms in the <code>Finset.sum</code> are zero. This is not what is happening if we do that at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/3355/files#diff-f33593ea969bf958e5cb05e696cc502c949d9abfd4241a1f4be934e01466c818R236-R239\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/3355/files#diff-f33593ea969bf958e5cb05e696cc502c949d9abfd4241a1f4be934e01466c818R236-R239</a><br>\nThe second goal is created, but the sum is not replaced by zero in the original goal!?<br>\n(In this particular case, I could circumvent the problem though.)</p>",
