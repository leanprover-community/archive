The linter says that <code>(v +ᵥ ·) '' affineSegment R x y</code> can be simp-ed to <code>v +ᵥ affineSegment R x y</code>, but that only works when we <code>open Pointwise</code>, otherwise this doesn't typecheck. Nevertheless, <code>simp</code> seems to be able to do this simplification without the locale open (using <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Set.image_vadd#doc\">docs4#Set.image_vadd</a>), thus introducing in the goal view a notation that doesn't typecheck <span aria-label=\"face with diagonal mouth\" class=\"emoji emoji-1fae4\" role=\"img\" title=\"face with diagonal mouth\">:face_with_diagonal_mouth:</span> <br>\nIs there a known fix (except disabling the linter) ?</p>",

I pushed this to the branch so we can see if mathlib builds. I'm not sure yet if there are other examples where this should be done, or we could lint for this.</p>",
