I've proved a bunch of basic results here: <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyxty/mathlib4/tree/master\">https://github.com/tonyxty/mathlib4/tree/master</a>, and a provisional proof of the substructure test can be found on the qe branch: <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyxty/mathlib4/tree/qe\">https://github.com/tonyxty/mathlib4/tree/qe</a>.</p>\n<p>The plan is to prove quantifier elimination for DLO, RCF, and ACF, and hopefully improve the overall design of this part of the library. If someone is working in a similar direction perhaps we can work together.</p>\n<p>I'm also interested in adding other classical results to it.  Things that came to mind include o-minimality, Morley rank, and quasi-finite fields.</p>",
