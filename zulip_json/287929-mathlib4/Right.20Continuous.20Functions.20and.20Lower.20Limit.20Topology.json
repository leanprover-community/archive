        "content": "<p>I would like to introduce the notion of lower limit topology. Namely the topology generated by intervals of the form <code>[a,b)</code>. The main motivation is that this topology gives a topological characterization of right continuous functions so that we can use theorems about continuous functions for right continuous functions. For example, in the Brownian motion project I want to prove Doob's maximal inequalities for right continuous martingales, and one of the essential lemma is that right continuous functions reaches its supremum on a dense set, which is <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Order/IsLUB.html#Dense.ciSup\">Dense.ciSup</a>. Potentially this new API about lower limit topology can simplify some proofs in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Counterexamples/SorgenfreyLine.html#Counterexample.SorgenfreyLine\">Counterexample.SorgenfreyLine</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I should mention that I am still relatively new to Lean and not very familiar with writing an entirely new API. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this and produce a good PR.</p>",
