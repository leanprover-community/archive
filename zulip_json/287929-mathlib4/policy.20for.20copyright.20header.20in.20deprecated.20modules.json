Do we have a policy about this? I was just checking them to see what such a PR looked like before I hit merge on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/25148\">#25148</a> and now I'm confused.</p>\n<p>Edit: Is the idea that these files get deleted by Jeremy in 6 months' time anyway?</p>\n<p>Edit: Andrew now added the copyright header so the question is kind of moot (to be honest I am slightly surprised that <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/24942\">#24942</a> passed CI!)</p>",
