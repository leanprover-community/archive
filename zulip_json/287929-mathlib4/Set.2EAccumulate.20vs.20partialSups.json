Currently in Mathlib we have <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=partialSups#doc\">docs#partialSups</a> which gives the supremum of <code>s j</code> for <code>j ≤ i</code> and is defined only for types with a sup but not necessarily an iSup and thus requires the index type to be <code>LocallyFiniteOrderBot</code>. On the other end we have <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Set.Accumulate#doc\">docs#Set.Accumulate</a> which does not require any hypothesis on the index type because the sets form a complete lattice. I would like to have an equivalent of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=disjointed#doc\">docs#disjointed</a> but for sets, but <code>disjointed</code> also requires <code>LocallyFiniteOrderBot</code> because it is defined via <code>partialSups</code>, so I had in mind to define a specific definition for <code>disjointed</code> adapted to sets, like <code>Set.Accumulate</code> is for <code>partialSups</code>. My question is: is it fine if I do this, or should we rather define this for a more general structure (complete lattice etc.)?</p>",
