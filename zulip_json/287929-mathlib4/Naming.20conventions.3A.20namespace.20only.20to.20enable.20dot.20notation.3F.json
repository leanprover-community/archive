        "content": "<p>We are implementing faces for cones and predicates for polyhedral cones and wonder about mathlib naming conventions:</p>\n<p>We implemented the predicate <code>F.IsFaceOf C</code> which states that the pointed cone <code>F</code> is a face of the pointed cone <code>C</code>. How should lemmas for this predicate be called? For example, if a lemma takes a hypothesis <code>(h : F.IsFaceOf C)</code> as input, I name it <code>IsFaceOf.foo</code> to make use of the dot notation. But if the lemma has no such hypothesis, do I still put it into the <code>IsFaceOf</code> namespace, or do I put it into the <code>PointedCone</code> namespace and call it <code>isFaceOf_foo</code> or so? An example of the latter would be the lemma that states that the lineality space of a cone is always a face. I have seen it done like this, e.g. for <code>exists_isCompl</code> is <em>not</em> in the <code>IsCompl</code> namespace.</p>\n<p>Likewise for the predicate <code>C.IsPolyhedral</code> which states that <code>C</code> is a polyhedral cone. Consider the lemma that states that a finitely generated cone is polyhedral. Should it be </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>IsPolyhedral.of_fg</code> or</li>\n<li><code>PointedCone.isPolyhedral_of_fg</code> or</li>\n<li><code>PointedCone.FG.isPolyhedral</code></li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are there global rules or is it more important to be consistent within our small part of mathlib?</p>",
