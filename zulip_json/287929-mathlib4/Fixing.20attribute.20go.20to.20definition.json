For example, to make go to definition on <code>simp [parity_simps]</code> jump to the <code>register_simp_attr parity_simps</code> line, which at very least is better than where it currently jumps to (which is to the definition of <code>simp</code> in core). Even better would be if the docstring -- which seems to be used to annotate the <code>register_simp_attr</code> lines in Mathlib -- would show up for the registered attribute on hover, and even better better IMO would be to automatically append it to the definition of the relevant other declarations (e.g. in this case appending it to <code>Even</code> that when using it you probably are interested in the <code>parity_simps</code> attribute). Can someone give me some breadcrumbs on which things are used to affect this behavior?</p>",
