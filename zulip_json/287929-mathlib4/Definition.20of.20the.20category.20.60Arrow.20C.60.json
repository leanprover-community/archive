Is this still on the table? <br>\nI may have a slot this week for investigating this, do you want me to look at it <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"459699\">@Joël Riou</span>?</p>\n<p>Similarly, <code>Square C</code> is currently an <em>ad hoc</em> structure. Is there an interest of refactoring it as a functor category as well? <br>\nNamely, define a <code>WalkingSquare</code> category, and define <code>Square C := WalkingSquare ⥤ C</code>, the two equivalences with <code>Arrow (Arrow C)</code> would then come from equivalences <code>WalkingSquare ≌ Fin 1 × Fin 1</code> (I guess in fact one of these equivalence could be <code>Equiv.refl</code>).</p>",
