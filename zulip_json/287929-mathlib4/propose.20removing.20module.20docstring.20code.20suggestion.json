As long as they aren't mentioned in the file it's possible for people to pick their preference. I think it would be better to have a page for suggested preference options which people can copy into their <em>user</em> settings if they agree.</p>",

In my mind, with the default setting off, a total beginner who is not used to IDEs will see the completion popup panel, try to select an entry with the arrow keys and Enter because that's the universal button to make progress in user interfaces, see that it doesn't work and then fall back to selecting entries by taking the hands off the keyboard and using the mouse. <br>\nI don't think that Tab is at all an intuitive shortcut for beginners, and I suspect that this is probably why most IDEs use Enter for completions, despite the fact that it sometimes gets in the way.</p>",

In my mind, with the default setting off, a total beginner who is not used to IDEs will see the completion popup panel, try to select an entry with the arrow keys and Enter because that's the universal button to make progress in user interfaces, see that it doesn't work and then fall back to selecting entries by taking the hands off the keyboard and using the mouse. <br>\nI don't think that Tab is at all an intuitive shortcut for beginners, and I suspect that this is probably why most IDEs use Enter for completions, despite the fact that it sometimes gets in the way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I just encountered this exact problem last week (trying to use enter for suggestions - with Mario sitting next to me and telling me to use tab).
