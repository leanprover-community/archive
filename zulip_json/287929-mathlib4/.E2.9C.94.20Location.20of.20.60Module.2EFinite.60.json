Is there any particular reason why this definition is located in <code>RingTheory</code> and not in <code>Algebra/Module</code>or in <code>LinearAlgebra</code>? The reason I’m asking is that I’d like to add a definition for finitely presented modules that should at least make use of the <code>Module.Finite</code>definition and I think this would make more sense to put it in <code>Algebra/Modules</code> rather than in <code>RingTheory</code>, but I’m not sure if it’s a good idea for future maintenance to have these related definition so far from each other.</p>",
