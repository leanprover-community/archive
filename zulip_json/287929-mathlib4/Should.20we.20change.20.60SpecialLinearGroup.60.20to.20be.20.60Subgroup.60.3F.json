Probably we should also have a second definition which would have type <code>Subgroup (Matrix n n R)ˣ</code> and could be called something like <code>SpecialLinearMatrixGroup</code>. The main point though is that by having type <code>Subgroup</code> a lot of boilerplate currently in this file could be dropped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",

I think that this is necessary. And I think that for all the classical groups (special linear, symplectic, orthogonal, unitary) we're going to want two definitions -- a concrete one and an abstract one -- and they should all be subgroups of the appropriate general linear group  because this is how they're used in practice.</p>\n<p>My only reservation about this design decision is that I have seen typeclass inference go haywire recently when faced with <code>\\u|-\\MCO K</code>(the type corresponding to the integers of a number field) and so am currently a bit nervous about coerced subtypes in general, but my impression is that the community are getting on top of these issues</p>",
