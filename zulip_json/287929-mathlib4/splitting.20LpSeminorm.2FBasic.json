It does not seem obvious to me how to split it, but I thought of moving the results about <code>eLpNorm</code> in one file and in an other the results about <code>Memℒp</code>. However those are mixed up in the file so I wanted to ask an opinion before attempting it. Tagging the authors <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"350992\">@Rémy Degenne</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110050\">@Sébastien Gouëzel</span>.</p>",
