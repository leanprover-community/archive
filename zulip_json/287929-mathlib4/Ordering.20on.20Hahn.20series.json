Might I ask why it's defined on the <code>Lex</code> type and not directly? I don't believe there is any other reasonable ordering one might give Hahn series. The colex ordering doesn't work, since the value group is only well-founded in one direction. The pointwise ordering does work, but isn't mathematically interesting. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"873350\">@Weiyi Wang</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span></p>",
