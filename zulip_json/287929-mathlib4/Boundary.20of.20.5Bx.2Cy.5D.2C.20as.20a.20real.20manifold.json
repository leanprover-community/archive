With the current Lean definitions, I think this is false - I'm claiming that the definition of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace#doc\">docs#modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace</a> ought to change.</p>\n<p>Under the current definition, a manifold <code>M</code> modelled on <code>I</code> is a <code>BoundarylessManifold</code> iff every point <code>x : M</code> satisfies <code>extChartAt I x ∈ interior (range I)</code>. <br>\nHowever, the model <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace#doc\">docs#modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace</a> maps to a <em>subtype</em> <code>EuclideanHalfSpace</code>. As I understand it, every point which lies on the \"mathematical\" boundary lies in the interior of the subtype, implying we get a <code>BoundarylessManifold</code> (which is not what we want, mathematically).</p>\n<p>More precisely: a point <code>x : EuclideanHalfSpace</code> with first coordinate <code>0</code> lies on the mathematical boundary of the half-space. If <code>EuclideanHalfSpace</code> were a <em>subset</em> of <code>EuclideanSpace</code>, <code>x</code> also lay on the boundary of <code>range I</code>. With the current formal definition, however, an open set (in the half space) containing <code>x</code> is the intersection of any Euclidean open ball around <code>x</code> with the half-space: this is open in the subtype <code>EuclideanHalfSpace</code>.</p>\n<p>Can we change the definition of boundary points? Not really, a model with corners need not map into some subtype.<br>\nThus, I propose changing the definition of <code>modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace</code>, to map into <code>EuclideanSpace</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Update: trying to actually change this, my proposal does not work, as the <code>source</code> of a model with corners must be <code>univ</code>. That issue about boundary is still unfortunately, though.</p>",

By design, there can be no boundary points here, everything is interior wrt the topologies of <code>X</code> and <code>H</code>.</p>\n<p>However, when we want to do differential calculus, we need to embed <code>H</code> into a vector space. This is the role of <code>I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H</code>. The composition of <code>I</code> and the charts, called extended charts, are not local homeos any more, and for these it can make sense to ask which points have a chart which is locally onto in <code>E</code>, and which points don't. This is how one can define the boundary of a manifold in our framework.</p>\n<p>Does it help?</p>",
