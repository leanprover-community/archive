Has there been any work done in formalizing dispersive PDE (in mathlib,  or elsewhere)? I saw mention of formalizing elliptic PDE <a href=\"#narrow/channel/113489-new-members/topic/elliptic.20PDEs/with/556681708\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Also, there is a TODO to formalize the analytic case for <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/ODE/PicardLindelof.html#ODE.contDiffOn_enat_picard_Icc\">picards theorem</a>.  Is anyone currently working on that? I don't see any open pull requests for it but just wanted to check.</p>",
