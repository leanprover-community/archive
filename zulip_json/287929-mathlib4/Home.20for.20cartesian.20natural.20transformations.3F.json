Apparently they are known in mathlib by their other name \"equifibered transformations\" which is totally fine, but they are located in the file <code>CategoryTheory.Limits.VanKampen</code>. Isn't the file NatTrans a more natural home for them? Other than Van Kampen colimits they also show up in double-categorical mates, polynomial functors and cartesian monads among other things.</p>",
