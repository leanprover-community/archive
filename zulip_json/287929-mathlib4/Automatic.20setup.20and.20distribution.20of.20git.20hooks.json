Would adding a <code>lake exe setup-hooks</code>, documenting its existence and recommend running it once when setting up a mathlib fork be acceptable?</li>\n<li>Which hooks would be considered good as having \"by default\"? I would say <code>lake exe lint-style</code> before pushing would be nice, what are other \"cheap linters\" that could be run before pushing? Conditioning pushing to a <code>lake build</code> is perhaps too much given that it might take a while on some systems.</li>\n</ul>",
