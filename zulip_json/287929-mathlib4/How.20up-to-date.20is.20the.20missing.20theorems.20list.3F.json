However, from the list of Lean projects (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean_projects.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean_projects.html</a>), there is this project: <a href=\"https://github.com/asouther4/lean-social-choice\">https://github.com/asouther4/lean-social-choice</a> which claims it has a proof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Does this mean the list just needs to be updated? If so, where do people submit a PR to update this list?</p>\n<p>Also, in general, can this list be trusted? For example, this list has Bayes' Theorem and Fermat's Little Theorem, both of which seem pretty doable with undergrad math knowledge. Can someone confirm that these two theorems are actually known to not be formalized? If they aren't, I'd like to start work on adding these to mathlib, but I only want to tackle it if there are no known formalizations of these theorems</p>",
