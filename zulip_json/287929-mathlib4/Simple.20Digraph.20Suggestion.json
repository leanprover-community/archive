Using <code>extends</code> with structures doesn't serve as an inheritance mechanism.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say someone has a <code>Digraph</code> and proves that it is loopless. Then, rather than being able to apply this tournament theory to it, they'd have to construct a <code>SimpleDigraph</code>, apply theorems to that, then somehow transfer the results back to the original <code>Digraph</code>.</p>\n<p>I'd suggest sticking with <code>Digraph</code> here with this <code>IsTournament</code> predicate.</p>\n<p>If there's some interesting structure on the type of all tournaments, you <em>might</em> consider it, to be able to define the relevant typeclass instances.</p>",
