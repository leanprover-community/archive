I have not seen topos theory in lean before so I am wondering if this would be a good addition to mathlib. My code is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/colbyaustinbrown/sigal/blob/main/Sigal/Chapter4/Basic.lean\">https://github.com/colbyaustinbrown/sigal/blob/main/Sigal/Chapter4/Basic.lean</a>, it will need a bit of work to make it more readable and mathlib style guide compliant, but I am wondering if there is any desire for this code in mathlib or other advice about this project.</p>",
