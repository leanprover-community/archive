It's intentionally a draft as it's too big to merge in one go. It will be split into smaller parts and merged incrementally. The first part is already under review <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/34209\">#34209</a>. The proof follows the basic-sequence approach of Pełczyński, so as part of the formalization I introduce a basic theory of basic sequences. There are two ingredients, that I missed during the fromalization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Definition of countable compactness. The full version of Eberlein–Šmulian states equivalence among compactess, sequentiall compactness and countable compactness, so I wanted to add the missing piece <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/35473/changes#diff-0133d5e53eb316ac9e03fc0a9906f75611e1518dad152b8d0a98dfa5eb3d68cf\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Some basic facts about inclusion of a normed space in it's double dual <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Module/Dual.html#NormedSpace.inclusionInDoubleDual\">link</a>. I needed that the inclusion is a homeomorphism onto it's image. Seems like the whole module is a leftover after some bigger refactor NormedSpace -&gt; Normed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm happy to open PRs for the above but first wanted to ask if I missed sth or is someone working on sth similar? I mean </p>\n<ul>\n<li>adding definition of countable compactness and basic facts like relation to compactness and sequential compactness</li>\n<li>finishing the refactor of NormedSpaces and adding missing basic facts about inclusion in double dual.</li>\n</ul>",
