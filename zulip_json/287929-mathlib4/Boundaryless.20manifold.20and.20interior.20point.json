For example, I’d like to give Lie groups a boundaryless instance. Currently, it requires the <code>ModelWithCorners</code> to map to the whole model vector space, so that excludes half spaces as the intermediate model space, even though you can still model boundaryless manifolds including Lie groups on the half space.</p>\n<p>Another point is that <code>I.Boundaryless</code> just looks a bit awkward. With the suggested change in definition I’d like to write <code>Boundaryless I M</code>.</p>",
