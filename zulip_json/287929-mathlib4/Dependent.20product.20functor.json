In particular, I'd need there to be versions of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CategoryTheory.Over.pullback#doc\">docs#CategoryTheory.Over.pullback</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CategoryTheory.Over.star#doc\">docs#CategoryTheory.Over.star</a> defined relative to said arbitrary cartesian structure. </p>\n<p>... So, first of all, does this exist in Mathlib? And second of all, is there a better way of doing what I'm trying to do here?</p>",

And now that I think about this further, I'm no longer confident that this is even mathematically sound to begin with; the tensor product will define its own subcategory of internal homs that won't really line up with <code>Over</code>, so I really need to be talking about that instead.</p>",
