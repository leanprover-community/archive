You can then make it work by writing <code>fun_prop (disch := tactic)</code>, where <code>tactic</code> solves the issue. Do you think it might be possible to implement a <code>fun_prop [h1, h2]</code> syntax to tell <code>fun_prop</code> it can use <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> to discharge side conditions? This would be more convenient I think. I do not know anything about meta-programming though so maybe it's quite complicated.</p>",
