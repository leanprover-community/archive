In my head, this goes with an extension of parts of the ring API (for instance, the ability to add and multiply terms) to extensions of <code>Language.ring</code>, such as <code>Language.ring[[R]]</code>. I've done this with the <code>Language.order</code> API, where most things are just about some language <code>L</code> with an instance of <code>L.IsOrdered</code> that makes it canonically an extension of <code>Language.order</code>, but I don't claim that I've done that API correctly.</p>",
