One is Action as described here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Action/Limits.html#Action.instHasFiniteProducts\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Action/Limits.html#Action.instHasFiniteProducts</a><br>\nseems to be developed particularly for representation theory.</p>\n<p>Another one is more \"traditional\" one, called MulAction, in here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Action/Defs.html#MulAction\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Action/Defs.html#MulAction</a></p>\n<p>It seems to me that everything category-related are only developed for Action, but not for MulAction. So are they disconnected? Do I have to make a choice when working with group actions? Or, are they \"identified\" in some sense by some theorems or some systematic method to transfer from one to the other?</p>\n<p>I will work with right actions, but the default is for left action. To use MulAction, I should consider <code>MulOpposite M</code>. What should I do if I use Action?</p>",
