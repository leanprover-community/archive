The tide has now caught up with work that some of my students are doing in mathlib3 and they're going to have to learn how to forward port edits to already-ported mathlib3 files. I want to point them to some wiki page or something, and I was expecting it to be the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Porting-wiki\">porting Wiki</a> but I can't see any mention of the description there. On the other hand I'm well aware that people like Eric have posted coherent explanations in the past. My memory is that the first thing I'm supposed to do is to wait until mathport has expressed its opinion, which in the case I have in mind has now happened. </p>\n<p>Are the instructions nothing more than \"look carefully at the mathlib3 PR, on the files changed tab, and note which files github is flagging as having been ported; now go to the mathlib3port repo and see its opinion; copy the relevant parts over manually and make a PR, and tag it...something\". Or are there gotchas I/they need to be careful about?</p>",
