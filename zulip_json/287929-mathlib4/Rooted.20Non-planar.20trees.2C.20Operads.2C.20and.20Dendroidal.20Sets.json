Before this I would like to hear if anybody has been working on formalizing the category of rooted non-planar trees and/or Operads/Multicategories. If not, i am open for suggestions or starting tips and collaborations are open for everyone.</p>\n<p>thanks for the attention</p>",

They are primarily defined to show how they fit together with Clones. (The end goal is to prove <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%27s_lattice\">Post's Lattice</a>.) I am not really an expert on all the things people do with operads, though, so I would welcome some feedback. In particular, is the current definition reasonable and functional for other things people would want to prove about them.</p>\n<p>I am aware that there are several possible definitions of operads, which is why I'd like some feedback. :)</p>",
