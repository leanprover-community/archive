The situation is unusual enough that I'm not surprised the linter is confused: a typeclass <code>ContMDiffManifoldWithCorners I 1 M</code> is necessary for the statement to make sense (it is required to endow the tangent bundle with a topology), but it can not be found by instance search, so I give it with <code>haveI</code> in the statement (so that the statement makes sense), and then again with <code>have</code> in the proof (so that the proof  makes sense). The linter complains wrongly that I should remove the ones in the proof.</p>\n<p>I have a \"fix\": use also <code>haveI</code> in the proof, instead of <code>have</code>. But it doesn't feel right.</p>",
