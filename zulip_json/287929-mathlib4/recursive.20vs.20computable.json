        "content": "<p>A silly question, perhaps...</p>\n<p>In recursion theory (or computability theory), there are two traditions of terminology: one uses terms like \"recursive,\" \"recursively enumerable,\" and \"r.e.\"; the other uses \"computable,\" \"computably enumerable,\" and \"c.e.\" to refer to the same concepts. The former is a relatively older, historical naming convention, while the latter seems to be more commonly used in recent times. However, in mathlib, there seems to be inconsistency in the terminology, as both <code>Computable</code> and <code>RePred</code> coexist. Is this an intentional choice, or is it merely a historical artifact within mathlib?</p>",
