Also warning, code quality is close to nonexistent…<br>\nOn the other hand, the formalisation contains no sorry’s or anything like that.<br>\nI also formalised the converse and a special case (cevians being all parallel), resulting in, from what I can see, the most general form of the theorem in the planar / triangle case. For the main case I used the classical argument with areas.</p>\n<p>The final statement appears to be more a bit general than the formalisations (by other proof assistants) listed for Ceva’s theorem in the 100 theorems list.</p>\n<p>For the final statement see the very bottom of (theorem ceva):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/felixpernegger/LeanCourse24/blob/master/LeanCourse/Project/Ceva.lean\">https://github.com/felixpernegger/LeanCourse24/blob/master/LeanCourse/Project/Ceva.lean</a></p>",

The concept of the interior of a simplex is common enough to justify having a separate definition rather than always needing to say \"interior of the convex hull\", the definition could always be linked to convexity later after the convexity refactor is done, or linked now only in the vector space case but with the definition being available more generally.)</p>\n<p>I concluded that the convexity refactor is not actually a dependency of any definitions needed for cleanly stating any past IMO geometry (or combinatorial geometry) problem - even when a problem talks about a convex polygon, definitions relating to convex sets don't really help for defining the property of a sequence of vertices being those of a convex polygon.</p>",
