This is for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It has a global <code>precision</code> value which gets increased each iteration across the entire expression. For example, if you have an expression like <code>1000 * sqrt 2 + exp 0.5</code> it will might expend loads of effort coming up with accurate approximations for <code>exp 0.5</code>, even though the accuracy of the <code>sqrt</code> term is much more important.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It throws away lots of information after each iteration. This doesn't matter as much as it sounds because only on the final iteration does it actually produce a proof term, and this is often the majority of the runtime of the tactic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It does no rounding on the rational numbers which appear as intermediate terms. This means that really big integers show up in calculations when they don't really need to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It uses the norm_num tactic many times to produce the final proof. Previously I was doing as much as I could with <code>reduce</code> which was much faster for <code>Nat</code> expressions but didn't work at all for rational ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I have not put any effort into making sure the computed approximations are actually reasonable. I think the <code>exp</code> one is probably fine, but <code>sqrt</code> is more questionable</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Then on each iteration it should only work on the section of the tree that is responsible for the largest share of the error.</p>\n<p>I think I want to implement more extensions (especially <code>log</code>, which was the reason I made this in the first place) before I change the approach though. That way I can measure what works best, and the tactic is already fast enough for some usecases.</p>",
