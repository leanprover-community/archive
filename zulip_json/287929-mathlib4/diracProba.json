I will just note that since <code>ProbabilityMeasure</code> is already in the namespace <code>MeasureTheory</code>, the full name <code>MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.dirac</code> starts to become fairly long. I guess we can expect people to have the at least the <code>MeasureTheory</code> namespace open when they use this, so probably that is not an issue. I am in favor of renaming to that.</p>",
