For example, yesterday I exchanged around 200 DMs with a group of people on the subject of just one basic Masters level definition, and there is still more to talk about (and possibly a refactor).</p>\n<p>In my Big Proof talk I listed the following missing definitions which we'll need to get (my proposed route to) FLT over the line (and I've tidied up/clarified the list a bit):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Group homology, Tate cohomology (of finite groups), continuous cohomology, <br>\n  local fields, fundamental characters, the Artin map,<br>\n  elliptic curves over schemes,<br>\n  abelian varieties, moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, <br>\n  Shimura varieties, etale<br>\n  cohomology, fppf cohomology, algebraic de Rham cohomology,<br>\n  classical de Rham cohomology, <br>\n  $L$-functions of modular curves and elliptic curves, automorphic forms <br>\n  and automorphic representations for $GL_2$<br>\n  and quaternion algebras, real/complex manifold associated to<br>\n  a smooth (connected) real/complex algebraic variety,\\ldots</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The list is out of date -- group homology is now merged!  But this list is highly skewed. I'm giving a talk tomorrow to a maths department and I wondered if I could get a more balanced list. What is missing from other areas of maths? Things that sprung to mind are: knots, Riemannian manifolds, symplectic manifolds. But there must be plenty more. I am specifically interested in things which are commonly-used by research mathematicians in mathematics departments (because this is a talk for research mathematicians in a mathematics department). What are other obvious examples of <em>definitions</em> which we don't have but surely need?</p>",
