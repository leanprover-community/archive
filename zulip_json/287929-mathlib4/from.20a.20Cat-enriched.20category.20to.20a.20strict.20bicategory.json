So perhaps that is the reason that is is missing. When the starting point is a Cat-enriched category this definition is more canonical, which is perhaps why it appears more centrally here. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> can say more about the simplifications it led to in the construction of the bicategory structure.</p>",

I think this can be improved by introducing <code>whisker_right</code> and <code>whisker_left</code> as the primitive objects in the definition of the monoidal category rather than <code>tensor_hom</code>, as I did in the definition of bicategory, which uses <code>whisker_right</code> and <code>whisker_left</code> instead of the horizontal compositions. I would like to do this kind of a refactoring if I can find the time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
