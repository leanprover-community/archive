Let $K/mathbb Q$ be a finite extension of degree $n$; $x\\in K$ not zero, and $d\\in Z$ such that $dx$ is an algebraic integer. Then, one  has<br>\n<span class=\"tex-error\">$$|x|\\ge\\(max(|\\sigma(x)|,d))^{-2n}$$</span><br>\nfor any morphism $\\sigma in Gal(\\overline{\\Q}/\\mathbb Q)$.<br>\nObviously, I want to use mathlib to do that. Not starting from scratch. <br>\nIt seemed easy, but no luck. If someone could help me, it would be nice. Thanks in advance.</p>",
