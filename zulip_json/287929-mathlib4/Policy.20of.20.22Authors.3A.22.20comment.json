Also, whether and when should I add myself to \"Authors\" in my PRs?</p>",

We don't have strict rules on what contributions qualify for inclusion there. The general idea is that the people listed there should be the ones we would reach out to if we had questions about the design or development of the Lean code.</p>\n</blockquote>",
