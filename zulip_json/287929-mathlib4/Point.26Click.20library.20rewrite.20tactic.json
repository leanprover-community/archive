Every time something changes (e.g. the cursor moves, or we shift-click select something), a new request is sent and a new task is started in the server to respond to it. This task occupies one thread in the thread pool; but there is a fixed amount of threads in the thread pool (depending on how many CPU cores you have iirc). So if the task is long-running (because, for instance, it searches the whole library for applicable rewrites), it might happen that a bunch of these long-running tasks will occupy the entire thread pool, thus leaving no room for tasks that would respond to editor requests. There are fundamentally two underlying issues: one is that the infoview sends too many requests, and the server ends up doing redundant/duplicate work; the other is that there is no way to cancel RPC requests. The latter one we could theoretically hack around in ProofWidgets (except for <a href=\"#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Should.20cancelling.20a.20purely.20mapped.20task.20cancel.20the.20original.3F\">this issue</a>), but a proper solution would involve changing the RPC protocol to support that.</p>",

This causes a problem when the pattern <code>a * a⁻¹</code> appears in multiple places with different values of <code>a</code>. This is because in the code for finding the occurrence, I assume that the <code>a</code> is already instantiated (since the argument <code>?_</code> has a known type). Ideally I would want the rewrite call to be something like <code>rw [IsUnit.mul_inv_cancel (?_ : IsUnit g)]</code>.</p>\n<p>I could also set the option <code>pp.explicit</code> to true, but that would also mean that <code>+</code> would be written as <code>HAdd.hAdd</code> which is not desirable.

What we have been doing so far is to put the TypeScript sources in a package <code>foo</code> that mathlib depends on which is such that <code>foo</code> can build TypeScript, but mathlib can just pull in a <code>foo</code> build archive that contains the JS outputs. Currently this specification uniquely determines <code>foo = ProofWidgets4</code>; if the widget doesn't depend on anything mathlib-specific, you could PR it there and I would review the PR.</p>",

I think it would be great if the <code>rw??</code> suggestions would contain one section with the unfolded versions of the expression. When selecting one of these, we could paste the <code>unfold'</code> tactic. But it is also possible to do any definitional rewrite with <code>rw [show current = replacement from rfl]</code>. I could imagine this actually being better because it shows in the tactic call what the replacement will be.

There were once rumors of work on a module system for Lean; I am not sure what the status of that is. Such features are desirable to provide statically checkable abstraction boundaries. Among other things, abstraction can be used to inform downstream consumers of a package which definitions they can freely use, and which ones are implementation details that may break at any time.</p>\n<p>But in the case of <code>Init.Omega</code> we just discussed, it's a simpler thing. The issue is that as soon as you import <code>omega</code>, every definition in the implementation (e.g. <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Init/Omega/LinearCombo.html#Lean.Omega.LinearCombo.coordinate_eval\">this stuff</a>) is imported wholesale into your environment, and the implementation details are not marked as such in any way. This is exactly why you end up needing an option/attribute/whatever to figure that out. Namespaces that are not open by default make this a non-issue for human-written proofs (because why would you <code>open Lean.Omega</code>?), but automation (i.e., tactics, like <code>rw??</code>) will go through the entire environment including <code>Lean.Omega</code>. There technically is a mechanism to prevent that: you can annotate definitions with <code>private</code>. It used to be the case that <code>private</code> definitions could not be made un-<code>private</code> downstream (e.g. if you do actually need to use some internal function from an imported module, and are okay with it breaking under you on version bumps) and people would complain, but now there is <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/std4/blob/d4161291e2a4c1c92d710bf670570aa79bf0d6ef/Std/Tactic/OpenPrivate.lean\">open private</a> so that it's a non-issue. Nevertheless, the <code>private</code> mechanism is not really a first-class feature. For instance, afaict there is no <code>private section</code> or <code>private namespace</code>. So the <code>omega</code> implementers would have to mark <em>every definition</em> <code>private</code>, which is rather annoying.</p>",

I could detect this, so that instead of showing the library rewrites, it explains why this particular subexpression cannot be rewritten. Is this desired, or do we still want to see the library rewrites, even if <code>rw</code> doesn't work there? Or a warning message, followed by the library rewrites?</p>\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/R9s_mbHH7lbTr2O2HCjfD15m/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/R9s_mbHH7lbTr2O2HCjfD15m/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/R9s_mbHH7lbTr2O2HCjfD15m/image.png\"></a></div>",
