In Lean 4 it is currently <code>↑(a + b) = ↑(if ↑n ≤ ↑a + ↑b then a + b - ↑n else a + b)</code> which is much easier to prove: it says that coerced (a+b) is equal to coerced (a+b) or coerced (a+b-0); indeed the current Lean 4 theorem can be proved with <code>simp</code> which is a bit suspicious. </p>\n<p>Assuming I've not made a mistake above, this means that the type of <code>coe_add_eq_ite</code> has changed. I would expect to see some warning about this in the mathlib3port file, but it <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3port/blob/19259d9e191af4fda3a89a15cf7ab944770f1b7d/Mathbin/Data/Zmod/Basic.lean#L327\">seems fine</a>. What have I misunderstood?</p>",
