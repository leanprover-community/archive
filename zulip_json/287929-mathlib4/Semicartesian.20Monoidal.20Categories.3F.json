However it is OK for the monoidal unit to be terminal. A category like this is usually referred to as \"Semicartesian\". Maybe the most famous example of a semicartesian monoidal – but not cartesian monoidal – category is the opposite of the category FinInj of finite sets with injections. Another related example is the category of nominal sets. </p>\n<p>Semicartesian Monoidal is not on mathlib, and it seems not on any branch either. I have some basic development including he example of &lt;finite sets and injections&gt;^op , but it would be nice to know if someone has already developed this stuff somewhere else. </p>\n<p>A design proposal: once we have <code>SemiCartesianMonoidalCategory</code>, I think <code>CartesianMonoidalCategory</code> should be an extension of this structure. In semicartesian setting we have <code>fst (X Y : C) : X ⊗ Y ⟶ X</code> and <code> snd (X Y : C) : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Y</code> for free, but without their universal property.</p>",
