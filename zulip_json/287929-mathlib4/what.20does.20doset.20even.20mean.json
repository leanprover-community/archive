Doset isn't a word, it's not searchable, it's not guessable, it's confusing. We have them in one file in mathlib so it's easy to change Dosets to DoubleCosets, which is what they are, and is what the literature calls them. I want to add stuff to this file and do stuff with topological double cosets but I cannot get used to the mathlibism name; I think we should stick to the literature. We could have a vote on it but given that it was trivial to do the search-and-replace PR because they're only in one file right now, I made <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/27004\">#27004</a> . Yes <code>Doset</code> is shorter than <code>DoubleCoset</code>. But why does this matter? If shortness matters and readability doesn't, I propose just changing it to <code>D</code> because that's just as incomprehensible.</p>",
