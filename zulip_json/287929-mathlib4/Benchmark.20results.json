As far as I can see it is mostly obsessives such as myself who are reading that topic. It used to be very noisy (there was a lot of false postivesi) but more recently it seems to have stabilised. It is still noisy; many of the posts there are things of the form \"this PR that added a bunch of results in file X making it 20% larger seems to have made the file X take 20% longer to compile\".</p>\n<p>However there are posts which are not of this form. For example <a href=\"#narrow/channel/116290-rss/topic/Benchmark.20results.20for.20mathlib4/near/544644455\">this post</a> was noticed by me obsessively reading the topic, resulting in <a href=\"#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/weird.20speedup.20in.20Mathlib.2ERingTheory.2ENoetherNormalization/near/545989244\">this question</a> which led to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30734\">#30734</a> which led to a nontrivial speedup of mathlib.</p>\n<p>I just caught up on reading this topic today, and here are a couple of posts which caught my eye: </p>\n<p>1) <a href=\"#narrow/channel/116290-rss/topic/Benchmark.20results.20for.20mathlib4/near/546713506\">this one</a> reports that <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30130\">#30130</a> (adding results about free groups) sped up <code>Mathlib.RingTheory.Kaehler.Polynomial</code> (a problematic file) by 7% and I have no coherent explanation for this. Is it real?</p>\n<p>2) And <a href=\"#narrow/channel/116290-rss/topic/Benchmark.20results.20for.20mathlib4/near/553971709\">this one</a> reports that <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/27270\">#27270</a> (turning <code>WithLp</code> into a structure, a change which was never benchmarked) had a catastophic effect on various number theory files and in fact had a gigantic effect on mathlib overall, making some files 15% faster and others 100% slower. Here is the <a href=\"https://speed.lean-lang.org/mathlib4/run-detail/ec6ce26f-3dfb-4ac0-a3f8-cb26d124e0d1\">speedcenter output</a>. </p>\n<p>My impression is that nobody is really looking at these benchmark results but that they're telling a very interesting story. Should the community somehow be paying more attention to them?</p>",

I do not know if/how this ripples through to <code>Mathlib.RingTheory.Kaehler.Polynomial</code>.  The PR initially had to add some hints to avoid a slowdown (see <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30130#discussion_r2450501580\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30130#discussion_r2450501580</a>).
