Part of it is a definition of the \"chase\" on \"disjunctive existential rules\", which requires possibly infinite trees of bounded degree. At the moment, I have an (admittedly rather ad-hoc) formalization of such trees: <br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/monsterkrampe/proof-library/blob/b533e058ba8875a72fca6951ffba520b6cec86c2/ProofLibrary/PossiblyInfiniteTree.lean\">https://github.com/monsterkrampe/proof-library/blob/b533e058ba8875a72fca6951ffba520b6cec86c2/ProofLibrary/PossiblyInfiniteTree.lean</a><br>\nThe idea is similar to using <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Stream/Defs.html#Stream'\">Stream'</a> to represent infinite lists.</p>\n<p>I am curious if the mathlib community would like to have something like this as part of the library. If this already exists in some form and I'm just not seeing it or if someone is already working on this, I would also be very interested to hear :)<br>\n(Of course feedback of any kind is also appreciated!)</p>",
