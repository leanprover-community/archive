It has some failures that I'd like some help with, in <code>Mathlib.Computability.Primrec</code>. The definition of <code>List.indexOf</code> has changed (the <code>==</code> test has been flipped), and thus the <code>Primrec</code> results talking about <code>List.indexOf</code> need updating too.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> (listed as author) or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"437861\">@Praneeth Kolichala</span> (who ported the file) might be able to help out?</p>",
