However it involved redesigning how we use <code>Mathlib.lean</code>, so please read on!</p>",

(by 26mb, compressed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to achieve this, I needed to redesign how <code>Mathlib.lean</code> works. In the new model, <code>Mathlib.lean</code> just says:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib.All</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib.Extras</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and now <code>Mathlib.All</code> imports (almost) everything (and this is still enforced by CI), while files in <code>Mathlib/Extras/</code> are imported in <code>Mathlib.Extras</code>. This enables a \"post-processing\" file such as <code>Mathlib/Extras/LibrarySearchCache.lean</code> to itself <code>import Mathlib.All</code>, and know that it has everything.</p>\n<p>To accommodate the cache file, we create a new <code>build/extra/</code> directory, that can store <code>.olean</code> format cache files.
