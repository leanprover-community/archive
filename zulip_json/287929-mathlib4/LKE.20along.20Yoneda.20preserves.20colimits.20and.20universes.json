I always thought that this theorem holds regardless of the target category, as long as it has the relevant colimits for building the Kan extension (e.g any category with <code>v₁</code>-small colimits  should be enough).</p>\n<p>It seems I can trace it back to the fact that preservation of colimits for the left Kan extension is proven through <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CategoryTheory.Presheaf.yonedaAdjunction#doc\">docs#CategoryTheory.Presheaf.yonedaAdjunction</a>, which assumes the same size constraint, but it does not seems super straightforward to change it (the constructrution of <code>restrictedYoneda</code> requires it). But maybe there is an alternative proof that the left extensions preserves colimits that does not assume this? </p>\n<p>The converse (preserves colimits -&gt; left Kan extended) seems to generalize smoothly to larger universes.</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"459699\">@Joël Riou</span>, who’s responsible for the latest version of there theorems according to <code>git blame</code>.</p>",
