The linter warning itself didn't tell me what to do, so remembering that there's several options which disable certain linters, i tried <code>set_option linter.unusedArguments false in</code> which failed. Then, i searched mathlib for a <code>set_option linter.unused*</code> occurrence (which there isn't). I also at some point tried to find <code>unusedArguments</code> but failed (which in retrospect was probably caused by a typo of some sort). Finally, I asked and was told the correct incantation was <code>@[nolint unusedArguments]</code>.</p>\n<p>All this is to say, it'd be nice if the linter tells you that you can use <code>@[nolint unusedArguments]</code> to disable it for some declaration, so i don't have to look it up next time...</p>",
