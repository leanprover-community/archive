For now I called the new folder <code>Geometry/RingedSpace</code>, but I am open to changing this (e.g. it could alternatively live in <code>Topology/Sheaves</code>).</p>",

I've been thinking that analytic spaces should be an intermediate step between Scheme and ChartedSpace after I saw your recent proposal above. (Aren't there some students working on GAGA?) I guess the perfectoid stuff also belong to analytic geometry rather than algebraic. Should we have folders Geometry/Algebraic and Geometry/Analytic rather than AlgebraicGeometry and AnalyticGeometry?</p>",

(I would actually like to move <code>Geometry.Manifold</code> up to the top level as <code>DifferentialGeometry</code> before it gets too much bigger.  But this can wait until we have a few things which are unequivocally \"geometry\" rather than just smooth manifold theory.)</p>",
