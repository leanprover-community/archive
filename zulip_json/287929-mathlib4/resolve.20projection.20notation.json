I want to elaborate the projection <code>e.projName</code> and get that as a new expression.  Is there some convenient way to do this? I tried <code>q($e.$projName)</code> which doesn't work (not too surprisingly). I could try to call the private declaration <code>Lean.Elab.Term.mkBaseProjections</code> which roughly does this, but I was wondering if there is a nicer way.</p>",
