Also, I failed to find the corresponding Mathlib 4 PR (and the porting status page lists the new file as unported, so I tried to start porting it). <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span></p>",
