I think this is really nonstandard and different from definitions I learnt in the past (i.e. <code>∀ s, 0 &lt; μ s → ∃ t ⊆ s, 0 &lt; μ t ∧ μ t &lt; μ s</code>). May I know the initial motivation for the design? Shall we change this definition? I think we should introduce the definition of <code>Atoms</code> (a measurable set that has positive measure and contains no set of smaller positive measures) and then use this definition to define atomic/nonatomic measures.</p>",
