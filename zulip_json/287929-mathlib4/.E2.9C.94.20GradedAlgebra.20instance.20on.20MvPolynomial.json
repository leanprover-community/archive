        "content": "<p>I've recently been using the MvPolynomial and I'm surprised to find that there actually isn't a GradedAlgebra instance on it. However, after some more searching, an instance named <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/MonoidAlgebra/Grading.html#AddMonoidAlgebra.gradeBy.gradedAlgebra\">AddMonoidAlgebra.gradeBy.gradedAlgebra</a> has been found in the folder about AddMonoidAlgebra. Since The MvPolynomial is defined as an AddMonoidAlgebra, I think probably redefining the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Homogeneous.html#MvPolynomial.homogeneousSubmodule\">MvPolynomial.homogeneousSubmodule</a> as a special example of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/MonoidAlgebra/Grading.html#AddMonoidAlgebra.gradeBy\">AddMonoidAlgebra.gradeBy</a> will enable us to directly use the instance on AddMonoidAlgebra. <br>\nSo, I'm wondering why would things be like this. Is this because of some consideration when designing the APIs? Thanks for your help in advance!</p>",

For this reason we don't want a default graded algebra structure which is why it's off by default. You can switch it on with <code>attribute [local instance] whatever_it's_called</code> and you can probably find it with <a href=\"http://leansearch.net\">leansearch.net</a></p>",
