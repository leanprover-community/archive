It would be helpful to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>diagnose these</li>\n<li>create mathlib4 PRs that manually forward-port the one/two-line change (and update the SHA), and include a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/file/ring_theory/subring/basic\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/file/ring_theory/subring/basic</a> link in their description, so that the reviewer can visually compare the diff</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We should wait for more tooling for the larger files.</p>",
