I’m just starting out with lean4 and want to use it to verify the correctness of some algorithms solving polynomial equations over prime fields.</p>\n<p>I wanted to start out proving that the equation „a*x+b=0“ can be solved by „x=-b/a“. But I’m having problems getting lean4 to understand that I’m dealing with a field and thus division exists if the modulus is prime.</p>\n<p>I also couldn’t find a place in mathlib where it states that it is a field if the modulus is a prime.</p>\n<p>Is this at all the right approach? I will later need the correspondence to Z because that is what most of the special cases the algorithm can solve is about.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>",
