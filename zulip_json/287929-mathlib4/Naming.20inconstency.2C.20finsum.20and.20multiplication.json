It does seem common however scrolling through the file that the primed version of a lemma is more general and asks for a specific <code>Support</code> to be finite. So consistency suggests to use <code>mul_finsum'</code> for the finite <code>Support</code> version. (Note: I have not really used <code>finsum</code>/<code>finprod</code> in any large capacity.)</p>",
