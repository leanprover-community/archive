It could also be used to add expected value and variance for distributions too (though idk if having those proofs rely on mgf is necessarily good for perf?). I've done a little bit of work already formalizing those for the binomial distribution. I wanted to check in to see if this is useful for Mathlib (pretty sure but just in case) and to ask about any broader context of developing Probability/MeasureTheory along with any Mathlib-specific guidelines that I should know about. Thanks!</p>",
