I use this to transport ring axioms from Mathlib's CommSemiring (PowerSeries R), then add the ℓ^1 norm structure with submultiplicativity.</p>\n<p>Are any of these already in Mathlib or too trivial to be made into a new lemma?

Sorry that I never got back to you after the brief talk about having trouble with leanblueprint during the Lean seminar. That problem has been solved in a recent PR. However, I made some changes to blueprint.yml, fixed <em>out of disk space</em> error, and added cache to optimize for speed across runs. Also changed to <code>texlive-smal</code> for a faster image pull. Details can be seen in my repo above. I'd love to know whether this is worth pushing to the main repo.</p>",

I don't think we have much of this, and at any rate the best way to exactly compare what you have done with what is currently in the library is through PR's. I don't know if you have already opened PR's to Mathlib, and if not it is probably wise to first have a look at <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html\">this page</a>: there are many very useful suggestions, often crucial for reviewers to actively work on your PR, but perhaps the most important one is the sentence</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you've made a lot of changes/additions, try to make many PRs containing small, self-contained pieces; in general, the smaller the better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can then mention here the PR number(s) for people to start looking at them.</p>",
