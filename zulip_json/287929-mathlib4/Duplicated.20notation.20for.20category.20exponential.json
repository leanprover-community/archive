The latter of these is barely used (only once throughout mathlib), is available in the global context, and clashes with xor on Booleans. I don't think this should be in a global scope, and I'm not even sure it should exist at all. How would people feel about removing the latter?</p>\n<p>Aside: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3/pull/2894\">mathlib3#2894</a> shows this was my fault all along!</p>",
