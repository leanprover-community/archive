The reason for this change is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.some</code> has to figure out the expected type <code>T</code>, and then elaborates to <code>T.some</code>.</li>\n<li><code>some</code> always elaborates to <code>Option.some</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, when I'm reading code that says <code>.some</code>, I need to think about what the expected type is in order to figure out what constant this elaborates to. On the other hand with <code>some</code> I immediately know what it means. And <code>some</code> has the added benefit of being 1 character shorter.</p>\n<p>I think the same logic applies to other inductive constructors that live in the global namespace, such as <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. It always makes more sense to write <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> than <code>.true</code>/<code>.false</code>.</p>\n<p>Should this be added to some style guide?</p>",
