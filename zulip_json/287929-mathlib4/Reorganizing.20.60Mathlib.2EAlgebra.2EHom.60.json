I believe the file defining a type of morphisms belongs alongside the file defining the structure this morphism works on. So I would like to reorganize these files so that e.g. <code>Mathlib.Algebra.Hom.Ring</code> becomes <code>Mathlib.Algebra.Ring.Hom</code> and <code>Mathlib.Algebra.Hom.NonUnitalAlg</code> becomes <code>Mathlib.Algebra.Algebra.NonUnitalHom</code>. Before I do so, any objections?</p>",
