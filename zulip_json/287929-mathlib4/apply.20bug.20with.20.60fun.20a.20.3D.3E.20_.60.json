Generally, switching to <code>refine</code> (or <code>refine'</code>) solves the problem. Is this a bug in <code>apply</code>, or is this expected behavior? If the latter, should mathport be changed? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> <span aria-label=\"up\" class=\"emoji emoji-2b06\" role=\"img\" title=\"up\">:up:</span> since you want us to report mathport problems.</p>",
