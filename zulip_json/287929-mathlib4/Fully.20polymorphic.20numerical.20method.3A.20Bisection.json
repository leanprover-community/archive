It finds a root in the interval [a, b], and when executing on floats, it agrees with Python numerical libraries works quite nicely when executing on floats. We made make it fully polymorphic to work with both <code>Floats</code> and <code>ℝ</code>, and prove termination and sub-interval generation thus far. Beyond these, what other properties, theorems or invariants about the code are there that are typically proved in this context? <br>\nI redefined mathlib definitions for now to get the code to agree with reals. Any questions, suggestions and critiques on style, refactoring  and so on... are welcomed as well.</p>",
