For example, on top of Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.Morphisms.Affine is a TODO to prove that affine morphisms are separated. However, it looks to me that this has already been done in <code>AlgebraicGeometry.IsSeparated.of_isAffineHom</code> in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Morphisms/Separated.html#AlgebraicGeometry.IsSeparated.of_isAffineHom\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Morphisms/Separated.html#AlgebraicGeometry.IsSeparated.of_isAffineHom</a>. Is this true or am I missing something? And if so, can this TODO be removed? I found something similar in Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.Morphisms.Finite for showing that a finite morphism is proper.</p>",
