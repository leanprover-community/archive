If you know anyone who might be a good fit, I’d appreciate your recommendations.</p>\n<p>Here’s more detail on the project and your potential contribution:</p>\n<p>Modern AI systems based on large language models have shown remarkable language processing abilities, mimicking human-like understanding. However, they fall short in reasoning, often producing inaccurate outputs with high confidence—leading to unpredictable failures. These limitations make them unsuitable for critical applications where reliability is key.<br>\nIn contrast, models capable of formal mathematical reasoning can guarantee correct outputs with transparent, interpretable reasoning steps. We believe this approach will make AI fundamentally safer, offering robust applications in fields like aerospace, chip design, industrial systems, and healthcare.</p>\n<p>Our vision is to build a model that can automatically translate natural language math problems into their formal representations in Lean 4—and this is where your expertise comes in.</p>\n<p>The role is paid, and <strong>even a few hours a day of contribution would be incredibly valuable</strong>.</p>\n<p>And again, all project results (code, data) will be open source.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>",
