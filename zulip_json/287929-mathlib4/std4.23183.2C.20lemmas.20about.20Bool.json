(This is not your fault: the Std queue has been slow.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this means that I can't bump Mathlib to match Std at 65544c31. Would you be able to do this bump? If so, when? I would very much like to have Mathlib in sync with Std again by the end of the weekend so I can do the next Lean release, either by doing the bump or undoing commits to Std. :-(</p>\n<p>(pinging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110994\">@Joe Hendrix</span> so he can see what's happening)</p>",

I was planning to update that PR soon anyway but I didn't expect <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/std4/pull/183\">std4#183</a> to land this soon. There's a couple of small things that were missing in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/std4/pull/183\">std4#183</a> as Eric pointed out. I'll try to do a quick supplemental std4 PR tonight (ping <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110994\">@Joe Hendrix</span>) Since <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/7984\">#7984</a> is already in master, I think we can get this all sorted out this weekend!</p>",
