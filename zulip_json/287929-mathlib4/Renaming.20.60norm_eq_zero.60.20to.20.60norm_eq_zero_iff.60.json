I don't care either way about whether it's renamed or not, I'm just putting forward the argument for keeping things as they are. However keeping <code>norm_eq_zero</code> to mean the thing that everyone uses all the time means that it's hard to find a name for a theorem that says that in weird cases, the norm is always zero, so probably the renaming is best if there really is an actual use case for a theorem of the form \"the norm of everything is zero\" (and I can't think of one, but there might be one).</p>",

Perhaps this conversation is an argument that iff should be added consistently in mathlib (maybe even in situations where there is no possible concievable usage for a theorem without the iff). But then of course you'll get people giving the same argument as mine above as to why the renaming should not happen.</p>",
