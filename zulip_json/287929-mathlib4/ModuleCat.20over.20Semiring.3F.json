It's certainly necessary to generalize ModuleCat if we want to study <a href=\"#narrow/channel/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Coset.20definition.3F/near/494642396\">Morita theory over semirings</a> (<a href=\"#narrow/channel/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Coset.20definition.3F/near/494527469\">see also</a>). I think we are also lacking APIs for <code>AddCon</code>s preserved by SMul and quotients by them and finite presentation over semirings, and also there's a <a href=\"#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Flat.20and.20finitely.20presented.20modules/near/494215849\">different notion of flatness</a> over (Comm)Semirings.</p>",
