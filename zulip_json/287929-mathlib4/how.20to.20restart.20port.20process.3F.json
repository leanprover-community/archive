As a result (a) the mathlib4 diff between the \"automated fixes\" commit and the final commit is confusing in a couple of places and (b) commit hashes will be different and merging <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/3939\">!4#3939</a> will cause some confusion with the backporting algorithm etc.</p>\n<p>All this could be avoided if I simply make a local copy of the final ported file and then simply start the port process again (once mathlib3port has picked up on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/19002\">#19002</a> -- when does this happen?) and copy my fixes to the Lean code back but leave the first few lines of the file alone. But I am a bit unclear about how this will work because the branch <code>port/CategoryTheory.Sites.DenseSubsite</code> already exists on github. Any advice?</p>",
