Motivation: while most of the time, we just want Lean to select the correct <code>R</code> coming from <code>S : Submodule R M</code>, for example, there are certain situations where we may want to allow a handful of fixed types. For instance, it seems natural to have an <code>SMulMemClass S ℕ R</code> instance whenever <code>R</code> is a semiring and <code>S</code> has a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=NonUnitalSubsemiringClass#doc\">docs#NonUnitalSubsemiringClass</a> instance. <del>Indeed, we actually already have this instance: <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=NonUnitalSubsemiringClass.nsmulMemClass#doc\">docs#NonUnitalSubsemiringClass.nsmulMemClass</a></del> (sorry that's in a branch of mine), but this instance kills the possibility of other <code>SMulMemClass</code> instances with something other than <code>ℕ</code>.</p>\n<p>Does this change seem reasonable (of course, for after the port)?</p>",
