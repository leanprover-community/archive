This is in terms of the specialization order on a topological space. It needs the notion of <em>immediate specialization</em>, which is basically <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CovBy#doc\">docs#CovBy</a>. But <code>CovBy</code> and its API is not available for the specialization order if it isn't an instance.</p>\n<p>This mostly plays a role in scheme theory. So I'm wondering, should a scheme <code>X</code> just have the specialization order as an instance by default? And do we want to make it an instance in terms of the existing definition? Or do we include the order as data in the definition of a scheme (together with an axiom that it is the specialization order) to enable forgetful inheritance?</p>",
