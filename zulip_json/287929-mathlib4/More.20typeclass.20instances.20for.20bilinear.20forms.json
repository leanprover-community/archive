Hence I need to write <code>[Fact B.SeparatingLeft]</code> all over the place (and yes, this will be a common thing to write). Is this okay? Or should one implement typeclasses?

But the code requires <code>Module.Projective</code> (which I added as an import) and also lemmas from <code>LinearAlgebra.Dual.Lemmas</code> (which I cannot import due to an import cycle). This suggests the code should go into <code>LinearAlgebra.Dual.Lemmas</code>. But the code has, on its surface, nothing to do with duality. Consider this lemma:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">theorem</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">SeparatingRight</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">id</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">Module</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Projective</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">R</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">M</span><span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">id</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">SeparatingRight</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I imagine it would be bad for discoverability to put it into duality files?</p>\n<p>Note that we develop a topology-free duality theory.
