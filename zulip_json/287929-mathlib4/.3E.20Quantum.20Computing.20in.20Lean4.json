        "content": "<p>Hi everyone, I’m here to introduce my lean-quantum project, an implementation of the theory of quantum computing in the Lean programming language. It is completely based on Mr.Duckki Oe’s formal work <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"236449\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/236449-Program-verification/topic/Quantum.20Computing/with/217784006\">#Program verification &gt; Quantum Computing</a>  in Lean 3, but I converted it into Lean 4. <a href=\"https://github.com/guest2180/lean4-quantum\">https://github.com/guest2180/lean4-quantum</a></p>\n<p>It took me about four months to convert most of the project and I learned a lot. There remain two files unconverted because they are not very related to other parts of the project and I’m lazy, but I proved the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in addition. Because there are many differences between Lean 3 and Lean 4, the conversion is more like a reproof (rw) rather than a translation.</p>\n<p><strong>Warming</strong>: Most of the definitions, lemmas, and theorems are completely the same as the original work, so some of them may be outdated or of no use in the Lean 4 development environment. Besides, I’m really a green hand, so some naming styles and proof methods may be awful. And because I’m not good at writing elaborators, I just use some simple macros to replace metas in the original project, which may loop for a lot of times, resulting in low and slow compilation speed. To sum up, it would be better to just refer to my proof ideas and details, rather than simply reuse this project in another Lean 4 project (I believe it will cause a lot of trouble).</p>\n<p>This project is open source on GitHub so everybody can use it. But it seems that I won’t modify this project for a long time, so I may not update this project even if someone offers some improvement ideas.</p>",
