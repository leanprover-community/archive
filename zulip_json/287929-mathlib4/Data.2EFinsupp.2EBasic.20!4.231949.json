However, after <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1958\">!4#1958</a> I don't think it affects <code>simps</code> anymore. Note that it still affects definitions marked as <code>simp</code> (without <code>s</code>). If you (redundantly) add <code>noncomputable</code> in front of every definition that has the <code>simp</code> attribute (if any), I think the attribute will be added (see example in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/2077\">lean4#2077</a>)</p>",
