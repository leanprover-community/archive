When building this I get the following (shortened) warning:</p>\n<p><code>warning: Mathlib/ModelTheory/Types.lean:10:0: Modules starting with Mathlib.ModelTheory are not allowed to import modules starting with Mathlib.Topology. This module depends on Mathlib.Topology.Defs.Basic\nwhich is imported by ....\nwhich is imported by this module.</code></p>\n<p>I'd like to merge these changes into mathlib if possible. Do I need to resolve this warning before opening a pull request and if so, how do I do this? Lake tells me that I can disable the linter, but this sounds wrong.</p>",
