The name implies what the tactic does, but it is only a name, there is no underlying meaning to the question mark.<br>\nThere can be however a <em>reason</em> why the authors of the tactic chose to put a question mark there, and that reason is related to the adjectives you gave, but the reason for a name of a tactic has nothing to do with the proof itself.</p>",
