        "content": "<p>For those interested in the intersection of historical mathematics and formal verification, I’ve just finished a Lean 4 formalization of an Euler-faithful proof of the Basel identity (∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n² = π²/6). The aim is not the shortest proof, but a historically aligned route - product over the zeros of sin(πz) and coefficient comparison at z = 0. The broader point is that Euler’s 1735 argument, while informal, can serve as a literal blueprint for a fully rigorous proof when expressed with modern local analytic language.</p>\n<p>Method sketch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Work with the normalized function sin(πz)/(πz).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prove two quadratic expansions at 0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sine side: from cubic control of sin z plus a normalization/0-patching step.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product side: avoid expanding an infinite product directly; extract the quadratic coefficient via a punctured-neighbourhood linear asymptotic for the logarithmic derivative of the Euler product limit function.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technical core (Phase 2C): rewrite logDeriv as a tsum of rational terms, perform termwise “Euler cancellation,” and justify passing the limit through the sum via a Tannery-type dominated convergence theorem with uniform summable domination on a punctured neighbourhood.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conclude via a small quadratic coefficient uniqueness lemma (baselSum = π²/6).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Zenodo archive is in preparation.
