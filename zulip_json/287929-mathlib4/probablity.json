        "content": "<p>Expressing the Quantitative Probability Analysis in Theorem Provers<br>\nTraditional real-time scheduling analysis aims to deterministically prove that all tasks meet their deadlines. However, probabilisticscheduling transforms this</p>\n<p>binary question into a complex quantitative issue. Theorem provers must now demonstrate that the deadline failure probability falls within a specified range, requiring identification of all failure cases rather than proving the existence of a single case as in deterministicscheduling. Furthermore, complex schedulability analysis often involves recursive proofs significantly affected by uncertainties in task execution times and arrival intervals. In probabilistic reasoning, the number of recursivederivation steps grows exponentially when multiple tasks arrive randomly and preempt each other, making 'recursive reasoning methods challenging to apply in probabilis tic scheduling proofs.</p>",
