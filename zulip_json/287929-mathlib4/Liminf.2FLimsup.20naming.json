I guess this is to have some sort of consistency with <code>sInf</code>, but it's really weird since <code>s</code> refers to <code>Set</code> and we are talking about a filter. An argument could be made about using <code>fInf</code> since the liminf is the natural extension of <code>sInf</code> to filters (in the sense that the liminf of a principal filter is just the infimum of the set EDIT: you need the set to be nonempty...), but I'd say the easiest way to solve it would be to keep <code>limInf</code> and <code>liminf</code>. Any thoughts on that?</p>",
