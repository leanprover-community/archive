I recently noticed that if you set the discharger to <code>measurability</code> or <code>fun_prop</code> it can be useable. However there are many lemmas which are not <code>simp</code> lemmas (likely because of these side conditions) which would be desirable with this discharger. Would it be best to just tag them as simp anyway or use a custom tactic with a custom simp set? Or perhaps someone has other ideas entirely. </p>\n<p>Note I would also like this to work for the Bochner integral eventually as well, but there is currently no automation for integrability (I think <code>fun_prop</code> could be made to handle some easy but useful cases).</p>",
