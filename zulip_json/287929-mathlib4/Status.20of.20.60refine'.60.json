Originally Lean 4's <code>refine</code> was like Lean 3's <code>refine</code>, but then the metavariable handling was improved, and the old behavior was renamed to <code>refine!</code> (and later to <code>refine'</code>). I think it's always been meant as a Lean 3 backwards compatibility tactic. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/2f4340f63cd9bdb0c9e773745edbe201d012b29d\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/2f4340f63cd9bdb0c9e773745edbe201d012b29d</a></p>\n<p>In the meantime, it's gotten even more complicated, since <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/cf2ea445fe31bb727e9c65afa632def3686089e8\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/cf2ea445fe31bb727e9c65afa632def3686089e8</a> made it so that <code>refine'</code> elaborates its <code>_</code> as synthetic opaque metavariables and makes synthetic opaque metavariables be assignable. These behave differently from <code>_</code>'s for <code>refine</code> (which elaborate as natural metavariables), both for elaboration under binders (due to creating delayed assignment metavariables) and for the defeq algorithm. Defeq performs ~worse for <code>_</code>'s in <code>refine'</code> than for <code>refine</code>, at least when they appear under binders.</p>",

There are various proposals aimed to improve this slice of <code>refine'</code>; it is not apparent to me whether anybody has actually worked on any of these. The existing replacements in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13385\">#13385</a> were acceptable to everybody. (There may be a spectrum of opinions here, but I didn't hear anybody specifically object to these.)</li>\n<li>some prefer to not simply ban all refine', but check if any further cases come up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two months ago, there were no uses of <code>refine'</code> in mathlib; they are slowly creeping in. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11884\">#11884</a> adds a linter which warns on uses of refine', but is worded in a soft way.
