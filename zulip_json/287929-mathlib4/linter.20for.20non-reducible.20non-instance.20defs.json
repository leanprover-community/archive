I'm asking because I just found out that <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MetricSpace.replaceUniformity#doc\">docs#MetricSpace.replaceUniformity</a> and friends are not reducible, which I'm about to go fix, but I had to find out the hard way that this was missing.</p>",
