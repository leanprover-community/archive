Andrew Yang pointed out in his review comment to the PR that we should be using <code>FiniteDimensionalOrder</code> directly, but we noticed that this would probably make the zero ring not finite-dimensional, since <code>FiniteDimensionalOrder α</code> doesn't hold when <code>α</code> is empty. </p>\n<p>So my question is that, should we make the zero ring to be not finite-dimensional? Or, should we refactor the definition of <code>FiniteDimensionalOrder</code>? </p>\n<p>Note: The definition of <code>FiniteDimensionalOrder</code> is <code>Rel.FiniteDimensional</code> with respect to the &lt; relation, and the definition of <code>Rel.FiniteDimensional</code> is that there exists a longest <code>RelSeries</code> (which doesn't allow empty series)</p>",
