A question that came up during this is Mathlib's stance on replacing manual proofs by automated proofs. For a simple example, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/32682\">this PR</a> proposes to replace some manual <code>List</code> proofs by <code>aesop</code>, <em>without</em> adding any new Aesop annotations.</p>\n<p>Advantages of this type of refactoring are (a) less clutter; (b) the new proofs may serve as regression tests, so if either Aesop changes or the Aesop rule set is modified and these proofs break, we know something is probably wrong.</p>\n<p>The main disadvantage is that automation is usually much slower than a direct proof, though the slowdown may not be large in absolute term (10ms vs 50ms, say). Additionally, there is a possible maintenance burden since the proofs may be broken by tactic or rule set upgrades, dual to the 'regression test' point above.</p>\n<p>Any opinions on this?</p>",
