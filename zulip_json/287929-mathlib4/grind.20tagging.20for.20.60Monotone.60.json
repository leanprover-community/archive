This is absolutely awesome, I invite you to have a look at the diff for a big smile. </p>\n<p>Given that I use <code>grind [Monotone]</code> several times, I tried to tag <code>Monotone</code> with <code>@[grind]</code> (with different options) to make sure everyone would benefit from it. However, this breaks proofs (in this file and in other files) -- to see it, just start from the PR, add <code>attribute [grind] Monotone</code> just before the theorem <code>add_point</code> and see how it breaks the proof, at the line <code>grind [Finset.sum_congr]</code>. I tried several variants, writing and tagging custom lemmas, but to no avail. Is there no good way to tag <code>Monotone</code> for <code>grind</code>?</p>",
