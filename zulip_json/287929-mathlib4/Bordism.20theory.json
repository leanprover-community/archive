The most cleaned up code can be found in PRs.</p>\n<p><strong>Most interesting obstacle</strong>. The core of bordism theory is the bordism relation, which entails speaking about the boundary of a manifold as a smooth manifold itself --- so we need a notion of \"the boundary of this manifold is a smooth manifold itself\". Mathlib's theory of manifolds is quite general, and includes e.g. manifolds with corners --- so I added a new typeclass <code>HasNiceBoundary</code> to encode this. <code>BoundaryData</code> encodes (or similar): working with cobordisms then requires passing a chosen smooth structure on the boundary.<br>\nI am not yet certain how workable this is: trying to prove some \"easy lemmas\" runs into some type theory questions, which could be easy and I don't see it, or indicative of a different design being necessary. The section <code>HasNiceBoundary</code> in <code>Bordisms.lean</code> has the details.</p>\n<p>I will not have too much time to think about this going forward --- if you feel like building on this, go ahead!</p>",
