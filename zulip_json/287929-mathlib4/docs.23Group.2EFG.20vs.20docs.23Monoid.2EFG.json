Finitely-generated groups are a well-studied thing and a serious area of mathematics; conversely most mathematicians haven't heard of monoids (this is another way that this question differs from the vector space question). So I propose that if we're going to deprecate one, we deprecate Monoid.FG, just like we talk about RingHoms between semirings etc. More precisely I mean we just delete Monoid.FG and redefine Group.FG to mean Monoid.FG and eat a monoid.</p>",
