This produces a long list of timings (summary timings for various components per file and individual timings for, e.g., typeclass inference if it took at least 100ms on my machine), which I then looked at to extract some information where potential gains could be had.</li>\n<li>I picked one of the top ten slow Mathlib files (<code>NumberTheory.RamificationInertia</code>; chosen because it is in <code>NumberTheory</code>, so I figured I could more easily fix stuff if necessary) and tried to speed it up.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The result of 2. can be seen at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12412\">#12412</a>: by a combination of</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adding local instances</li>\n<li>squeezing simps</li>\n<li>filling in <code>_</code>s</li>\n<li>replacing slow tactics by faster ones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was able to get a speed-up by a factor of 3.</p>\n<p>What I did was to add <code>set_option profiler true</code> at the beginning of the file; then I tried to edit things to make most lines in its output saying that something took 100ms or more disappear. If it was a slow typeclass search, I added <code>set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true in</code> before the relevant declaration to find out which exact instance it was looking for, then added a shortcut instance for that (with the term that <code>#synth</code> found for me).</p>\n<p>The take-away is that by investing some work, slow files can be made quite a bit faster, but this is not an efficient process that can be used on a larger scale (say, to speed up the slowest 200 files by 50% or so).</p>",

I mean, if you're looking for an instance of the form <code>[Subsingleton α]</code> where <code>α</code> is just a generic type then there is nothing to discriminate against, so all instances that always apply have to be searched, but you could eliminate right away all the instances of the form <code>Subsingleton (Foo m n)</code>. And conversely if you're looking for an instance of the form <code>Subsingleton (Bar a b)</code>, then you could also eliminate right away all instances like <code>Subsingleton (Foo m n)</code> if <code>Bar</code> is not <code>Foo</code>, i.e., you could use a discrimination tree one step further. </p>\n<p>(I'm aware that this if very naive, because you would maybe need to reduce <code>Foo</code> or <code>Bar</code> before making this kind of search, and this can be expensive, but I would argue that in this kind of context one shouldn't reduce at all, everything should be purely syntactic).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm guessing that most of the time is spent on <em>failing</em> type-class searches, to see if certain goals don't have to be generated.

Among many other things, this has the effect of generating an instance <code>OrderedSemiring.toSemiring</code> with default priority 1000. So all these instances tend to be early in the list of instances that are tried when looking for a <code>Semiring</code> structure (say) (note that the files under <code>Mathlib.Algebra.Order</code>, where these classes are defined, seem to be imported by a very large part of Mathlib), leading to the algorithm going on a hunt for order structures.</p>\n<p>The idea now is to try to decouple the algebra+order hierarchy and the pure algebra hieraarchy by (preferably) making these instances scoped, so that they do not cause problems in the cases where they slow down instance synthesis, but can be made available when needed. However, this does not seem to work: while the instance attribute can be removed in the file defining the instance, this has no effect on downstream modules. So the next best solution is to reduce the priority to something small (like 50) instead; this persists in downstream modules. In addition, we add the high priority versions, scoped to <code>AlgebraOrderInstances</code>.</p>\n<p>I have done this in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12778\">#12778</a> to quite good effect: many files build siginifcantly faster; the overall build instructions count goes down by more than 2.5% (still less than what we could save by making <code>#align...</code> a no-op...), and time for typeclass inference goes down by 6.6%.

Even the somewhat ham-handed approach used in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12778\">#12778</a> leads to a larger than 2.5% reduction of the instruction count for building Mathlib and a gain of about 8% in typeclass search.</li>\n<li>As Yaël has said earlier, the approach taken with scoping high-priority versions of the instances relating the hierarchies is a bit annoying to use: I added the line <code>open scoped AlgebraOrderInstances</code> to about 100 files (judging by the speed center output where it may be helpful).</li>\n<li>Having a more targeted solution that always (or almost always) does the right thing should give even more of a speed-up. The version in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12778\">#12778</a> decides on a per-file basis whether the connecting instances should have high or low priority, but it is well possible that the best choice varies within a file. (One could, of course, apply the <code>open scoped</code> in a more local way, but to find out where precisely this should be done is more work than I would be willing  to do.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot is, I am very much looking forward to the refactor Yaël proposes! <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span> How would it differ from the attempt in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6326\">#6326</a> mentioned by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"455791\">@Yuyang Zhao</span> above?</p>",

During the type class search, the only instance that is found is <code>OrderedCommMonoid.toCovariantClassLeft</code>, which has a multiplication operation derived from a <code>OrderedCommMonoid</code> instance. But the multiplication in <code>inv_le_one'</code> is derived from a <code>Group</code> instance. So unification isn't able to relate the <code>Group</code> and <code>OrderedCommMonoid</code> instance. Therefore, synthesis returns <code>.none</code>, implying that no instance will ever be applicable. But by hacking in another instance that causes type class search to return <code>.undef</code>, we try synthesizing again later when the metavariables are instantiated. And at that point we know that our type has a <code>OrderedCommGroup</code> instance.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've made more progress on speeding up type-class search for Mathlib.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I made a big oversight when implementing the caching of intermediate type class results: I only stored positive results. Caching intermediate failures is also useful. This is a bit more complicated than it seems at first, because of the loop-detection: a search branch can \"fail\" due to a detected loop, but that doesn't mean that there will not eventually be an instance found for it. So I keep a <code>noLoops : Bool</code> in the state and only cache failures when <code>noLoops := true</code>. In the first version I just set <code>noLoops</code> to false whenever the search tree becomes a non-tree. This gave another speedup of around 8% to type class search in mathlib. I then replaced this with a more sophisticated algorithm that can tell apart a diamond from a loop, so that negative caching can happen even more often, but the speedup from this was relatively neglegible. See <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13191\">#13191</a> and see below.</li>\n<li>The recent optimization of canonical instances is only applied when the subgoal doesn't have metavariables. But I believe that it should also apply when the subgoal has level metavariables. This gives a marginal overall speedup of 0.011% (I think that is statistically significant) <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13194\">#13194</a>.</li>\n<li>The implementation of the TC algorithm truns out to be a bit sloppy, so by cleaning it up, I managed to get another speedup: mathlib overall becomes 0.8% faster (so ~2.8% speedup for TC resolution) (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13207\">#13207</a>). This includes things like deduplicating a computation that is done twice, and making sure that computations meant for trace messages are only executed when the trace option is set to true. This performance improvement is orthogonal to the other one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the benchmark for the improved intermediate TC result caching:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"

The reason is that instead of caching intermediate results globally at the end of a <code>synthInstance?</code> call, this is done immediately. So if there is a diamond, say with instances AA =&gt; AB, AA =&gt; BA, AB =&gt; BB, BA =&gt; BB, and if we get subgoal BB. Then first we find subgoal AB, and then AA. Then AA fails, and this is globally cached, and so AB fails and this is globally cached. Next we find subgoal BA and then AA again. But since we first lookup AA in the global cache, we see that AA has no solutions, and crucially we did not detect that there is a diamond, because of finding AA in the global cache instead of the local cache, keeping <code>noLoops := true</code>.</p>\n<p>So now it only (locally) registers that an entry is done when the entry is not able to be cached globally.</p>",

This is because <code>outParam</code> are treated differently when they are the main goal vs an intermediate goal: Every <code>outParam</code> argument in the main goal is replaced by a fresh metavariable, that is unified with the original argument after the type class search. This means that if someone came along and added a high priority instance for <code>HAdd Nat Nat Int</code>, then <code>HAdd Nat Nat Nat</code> will fail as a main goal, but <code>HAdd Nat Nat Nat</code> will succeed if it is an intermediate goal. I'm not convinced this is a beneficial state of affairs (see also <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4225\">lean4#4225</a>), but I think my extra caching shouldn't change this behaviour.</p>\n<p>After this change the total mathlib speedup is 4.6% instead of 5.1%.</p>",

It is hard to disentangle the reordering, the changes in priority for projections from preferred and non-preferred parents, and the new backwards compatibility flags being enabled. </p>\n<p>My guess is that by moving the parent with the deepest/most data fields to the preferred slot you can avoid defeq checks on the data itself probably because they become syntactic equalities earlier in the process. </p>\n<p>How much of the changes to the priorities can be achieved by just asking core to set new values for the projections from preferred and non-preferred parents? Everyone seems to think this is a problem but we haven't had good hard performance-based evidence for a change to bring to core. It would be great and much less ad-hoc if this was it. </p>\n<p>Turning on new backward compatibility flags is probably not going to get merged though. So we will have to understand the regressions there better and either fix themselves ourselves or make a compelling case upstream.</p>",

(This also needs a dedicated delaborator, written just below it.) Has anyone tried replacing this with a call to a <code>setToType</code> function? The specific reason I have to believe that this will improve performance across the library is that I can see failed instance searches caused by the fact that the indexing is not able to handle the lambdas: if I have definitions <code>foo, bar : Subgroup G</code> then <code>CommGroup ↑foo</code> also attempts to apply an instance for <code>CommGroup ↑bar</code>. Normally this would not happen because the discrimination tree can tell them apart, but after the aforementioned elaboration the result is <code>CommGroup {x // x ∈ foo}</code> vs <code>CommGroup {x // x ∈ bar}</code> and lean gives up indexing at the lambda.</p>",

Since the <code>Mul</code> hierarchy is very big, this can be slow to fail, especially when there is no such <code>Mul</code> instance.</p>\n<p>A long-term but harder to achieve solution would be to specify the order in which instance goals get solved. For example, we'd like to change the arguments to <code>map_mul</code> to look like <code>[FunLike F M N] [Mul M] [Mul N] [highPriority &lt;| MulHomClass F M N]</code> because <code>MulHomClass</code> fails or succeeds much faster than the others.</p>\n</blockquote>",
