There are three versions proposed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>CommAlg</code>, if we use this convention we should probably rename <code>AlgebraCat</code> to <code>Alg</code>. This agrees with the notation for <code>Grp</code> and <code>CommGrp</code>. It also is analogous to how &lt;algebraic object&gt;-object categories are named: <code>Mon_ C</code>, <code>Grp_ C</code> etc.</li>\n<li><code>CommAlgCat</code>, agrees with category names such as <code>MonCat</code> and <code>RingCat</code>. It also makes clear that we're talking about a category, and hopefully allows us to avoid issues with overzealous abbreviation (see <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Doset.doset#doc\">docs#Doset.doset</a>).</li>\n<li><code>CommAlgebraCat</code>, agrees with<code>AlgebraCat</code>. This option is arguably the most consistent with the current naming in mathlib, but it is a mouthful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think the first convention is the best as long as it doesn't cause any issues, and we might want to consider renaming other categories to have consistent notation across the board.</p>",
