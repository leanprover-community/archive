This came up in FLT-related work, because some Imperial students want to talk about maximal subfields of a K-algebra D where D is not a field (or even a division ring). They can't use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=IntermediateField#doc\">docs#IntermediateField</a> because this wants to eat fields. I realised that this convention stretches right down to the basics.</p>",
