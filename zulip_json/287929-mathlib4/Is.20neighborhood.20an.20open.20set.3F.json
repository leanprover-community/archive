Very often people want open neighborhoods because they are taught to use theme everywhere, but any neighborhood would be good enough. For instance maybe in your case you could use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Compactness/Compact.html#IsCompact.elim_nhds_subcover_nhdsSet\">IsCompact.elim_nhds_subcover_nhdsSet</a>, but it’s hard to say without seeing your code. Maybe you do need open neighborhood and then we’ll be able to tell you how to get them very efficiently.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span>  Because we are trying to write a scheme for a theorem's proof in lean, which is the uniform Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property in nonconvex optimization theory, I'm just considering how to write the code properly and haven't begin to write the code. Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property mainly tells that for any point in a set, there exists a neighborhood satisfying an inequality, and we want to use these neiborhoods to build a open cover, then use the finite cover theorems, which is used in the proof. Thanks for your remind of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Compactness/Compact.html#IsCompact.elim_nhds_subcover_nhdsSet\">IsCompact.elim_nhds_subcover_nhdsSet</a>, which I think it should be what we really want, because we won't use any properties of open sets.</p>",
