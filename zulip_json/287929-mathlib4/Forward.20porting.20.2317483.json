I've pinged <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span> privately to check they're happy with it. I think this should be easy enough to forward port to justify merging it, but want to double check everything before creating forward-porting work</li>\n<li>Wait for mathport to regenerate against your new output. That happens every 24 hours I think.</li>\n<li>Use the mathport output to update <code>src/Algebra/Group/Basic.lean</code>.  This is a somewhat manual process unfortunately.</li>\n<li>Fix all the downstream proofs again using the mathlib3 PR as a guide. You can avoid actually installing Lean 4 on your local machine by using <a href=\"https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4\">https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4</a>. Make sure to update the header SHAs in all the files you fix.</li>\n</ul>",
