The packathons will essentially be brainstorming sessions to tackle various project TODOs.</p>\n<p>We will resume tomorrow (and reconvene every Monday thereafter till the end of term) at 17:30 Eastern Time ( <time datetime=\"2025-10-20T21:30:00Z\">2025-10-20T17:30:00-04:00</time> ). We expect to be working in-person, but if anyone who isn't local would like to join us, the room has a fantastic Zoom setup - just send a message here and we can sort it out! If there is sufficient demand from other timezones, we can consider rescheduling to an earlier time. The whole thing is intended to be quite informal.</p>\n<p>Local or not, hope to see you at a packathon sometime soon!</p>",

For instance, to show that the Fourier eigenfunctions that make it up are, indeed, Fourier eigenfunctions, we need to show that the Fourier transform permutes the integrals that make it up (with a sign change in the case of the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">-1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7278em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">−</span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span>-eigenfunction). The reason this shows the eigenfunction property is that integrals are themselves Schwartz, so the Fourier transform acts linearly on them. So I feel like proving that the Poisson summation formula is applicable to the magic function is not enough: I think Schwartzness is more intrinsic to the proof.</p>",

We have turned it into a draft PR so it isn't accidentally merged.</li>\n<li>Math Inc will break it up into 3 smaller (draft) PRs: one that largely contains stuff about modular forms (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"389019\">@Chris Birkbeck</span>'s review area), one that largely contains stuff about the magic function (my review area), and one that contains stuff about the inequalities (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"588998\">@Seewoo Lee</span>'s review area).</li>\n<li>We invite community collaborators to pick (mergeable) theorems from <strong>any one of the areas</strong> (not across areas please - this would make the review process harder) to review, edit, golf and PR to the repo. When you make the new PR, please add Gauss as a co-author (unless you redo the proof completely or in some other way discard Gauss's contributions entirely).</li>\n<li>Once we merge a Gauss-offshoot PR, Math Inc will rebase the appropriate parent draft PR to incorporate the change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea is we will never actually merge Gauss's mammoth PR or any of the 3 smaller PRs (basically I told <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321854\">@Auguste Poiroux</span> thank you for your time, not interested (just kidding!)). The point is, we will merge smaller, more modular PRs that are easier to review, and keep rebasing the big ones off of these.</p>\n<p>This process will probably undergo numerous revisions as it progresses; for now, we're going to see how it goes. In parallel, I will resume reviewing some of the earlier PRs, and if they are better than the corresponding Gauss code, we will merge those instead.</p>\n<p>Guidelines for choosing lemmas to PR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose lemmas that only make progress towards <em>one idea</em> or <em>one goal</em> (or pick a <em>small number of lemmas</em> that show <em>related ideas</em>).</li>\n<li>When PRing a definition, please also include any accompanying API. Ideally also say a word or two about where it is used.</li>\n<li><strong>Remember to include corresponding blueprint changes</strong> (eg. <code>\\leanok</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>No more than 1000 lines PLEASE.</strong> Ideally in the range of a few hundred, definitely not over 1000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will reconvene <time datetime=\"2026-03-03T15:30:00Z\">2026-03-03T10:30:00-05:00</time>, entirely on Zoom at <a href=\"http://cmu.zoom.us/my/sidharth.hariharan\">cmu.zoom.us/my/sidharth.hariharan</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi everyone!<br>\nSo I have been trying to split the Gauss PR into three smaller PRs as discussed, but I am facing a few challenges that I believe we should discuss before proceeding:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The three areas (modular forms, magic function, and inequalities) are not independent, and in the Gauss PR there are interdependencies on newly introduced content -&gt; splitting that into independent PRs while keeping the build green is difficult</li>\n<li><code>module</code> system: files using the <code>module</code> system can't import files that are not using it</li>\n<li>Lean version difference: v4.27.0 vs v4.28.0</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For 2 and 3, I suggest the following: first bumping main to Lean v4.28.0, then having a PR to port the codebase to the module system (as already suggested by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"588998\">@Seewoo Lee</span> <a href=\"https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/Sphere-Packing-Lean/pull/341#issuecomment-3947758725\">in the gauss PR</a>). The three PRs will then be based on top of that.<br>\nFor 1, I see two routes, but please feel free to suggest any other ideas you might have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Route A: we make three PRs as independent as possible, and to make this possible, we introduce theorem / definition placeholders for the introduced interdependencies to maintain the build green with a minimal interface / minimal duplication. We might even consider doing more than three PRs for common files like NormNumI, files in ForMathlib, ...</li>\n<li>Route B: the three PRs build on top of each other: modular forms -&gt; magic function -&gt; inequalities. This is more natural and easier to do, but this slightly defeats the purpose of reviewing these different parts independently + the content from magic function and inequalities can't be merged until the modular forms PR is merged.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking forward to your opinions on this!</p>",

It sounds similar to route A but not quite.<br>\nDo some parts depend on <em>definitions</em> from other parts, rather than theorems? If so then is it possible to make the theorems that are \"exported\" from one part to the other not mention their own definitions, and treat the definitions as private to the part that defines them? (because sorrying definitions is problematic, as was mentioned in the packathon)</p>",

If we go this route, I believe first porting the codebase to the module system is necessary as a first step (which I am happy to do automatically if maintainers are ok with that), otherwise each PR will have to independently port the project  to Lean v4.28.0 + the module system. I also think that it might be even better to split the Gauss PR into more PRs for common files shared across all three developments (but then once again, it is making all the PRs conditional on the previous ones to be merged, so there is a balance here).</p>",
