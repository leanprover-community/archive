While these contributions really have been fantastic (thank you!), I'd like to request that the people running these models on our repository first take a look at the PR queue and only run them on files that aren't being worked on in other PRs. We've already had two instances of duplicate/redundant PRs. If you'd like to help with PRs still in progress, then please contact the PR authors and see if you can help them.</p>\n<p>On another note, there are a number of PRs that I would like to review, but I am quite busy for the next few days. I will try and get some of them merged at ItaLean next week, especially the ones whose authors will be there in-person.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",

These are basically the integrals that appear in <code>d</code>. Since the techniques used to prove integrability are always the same, I think that the best option would be to have a general lemma that can be invoked in each of the relevant cases. Do you think that's possible?<br>\nThe relevant goals should be the following, and some of them are equivalent (you can get one from the other by changing variables, but Lean still requires to prove integrability separately):</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><code>IntegrableOn (fun t ↦ I * φ₀'' (-1 / (I * ↑t)) * (I * ↑t) ^ 2 * cexp (I * ↑π * ↑r * (I * ↑t))) (Ici 0) volume</code></li>\n<li><code>IntegrableOn (fun t ↦ φ₀'' (-1 / (↑t * I)) * (↑t * I) ^ 2 * cexp (↑π * I * ↑r * (-1 + ↑t * I))) (Ioi 1) volume</code></li>\n<li><code>IntegrableOn (fun t ↦ φ₀'' (-1 / (↑t * I + 1)) * (↑t * I + 1) ^ 2 * cexp (↑π * I * ↑r * (↑t * I))) (Ioi 1) volume</code></li>\n<li><code>IntegrableOn (fun t ↦ φ₀'' (-1 / (↑t * I)) * (↑t * I) ^ 2 * cexp (↑π * I * ↑r * (1 + ↑t * I))) (Ioi 1) volume</code></li>\n<li><code>IntegrableOn (fun t ↦ φ₀'' (-1 / (↑t * I - 1)) * (↑t * I - 1) ^ 2 * cexp (↑π * I * ↑r * (↑t * I))) (Ioi 1) volume</code></li>\n<li><code>Integrable (fun t ↦ I * (φ₀'' (-1 / (↑t * I)) * (↑t * I) ^ 2 * cexp (↑π * I * ↑r * (-1 + ↑t * I)))) (volume.restrict (Ici 0))</code><br>\nWe should try to prove a general lemma for integrability on <code>Ioi 0</code> of integrands similar to <code>φ₀'' (-1 / (a + I * t)) *  (a + I * t) ^ 2 * cexp (π * I * r * (I * t + b))</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, to apply Cauchy-Goursat some continuity and differentiability hypotheses are required but they should already be somewhere in the codebase, I will look for them in the next few days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vanishing of the integrands that are involved in Cauchy-Goursat as <code>Im(z)</code> approaches infinity. This should require the bounds on page 41 of Sid's thesis. These will probably show up while proving integrability, but please state them as separate lemmas so that I can fill in the hypotheses for Cauchy-Goursat.<br>\nThe relevant goals are the following:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><code>∀ ε &gt; 0, ∃ M, ∀ (z : ℂ), M ≤ z.im → ‖φ₀'' (-1 / (z - 1)) * (z - 1) ^ 2 * cexp (↑π * I * ↑r * z)‖ &lt; ε</code></li>\n<li><code>∀ ε &gt; 0, ∃ M, ∀ (z : ℂ), M ≤ z.im → ‖φ₀'' (-1 / (z + 1)) * (z + 1) ^ 2 * cexp (↑π * I * ↑r * z)‖ &lt; ε</code><br>\n(These could probably be expressed more concisely using <code>Filter</code>s and <code>atTop</code>, if you prefer more idiomatic and mathlib-like code)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let me know if this summary is complete enough, and thanks for your work!</p>",
