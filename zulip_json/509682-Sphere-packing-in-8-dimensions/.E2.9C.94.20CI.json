The fact that things were broken at one point does not mean they are broken now. If you really want to test out the workflows, which we have done several times, instead of making spurious references to workflow files without any explanation, why don’t you try actually claiming an issue for yourself and making a worthwhile contribution to this project? Or, if you still insist that the workflows are wrong, why don’t you make a PR with a fix? Just know that we do expect those who claim issues/make PRs to actually work on them, and that we will be very strict in reallocating/closing them if we feel like the underlying motivations are insincere.</p>",
