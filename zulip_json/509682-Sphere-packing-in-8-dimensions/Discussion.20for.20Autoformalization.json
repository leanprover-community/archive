href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Subgroup.widthInfty#doc\">docs#Subgroup.widthInfty</a> and then made some API for it. Gauss' version is only for subgroups of  SL(2, ℤ) while in mathlib its for subgroups of  GL_2  ℝ. So here, while this is maybe a definition you might see in a book, its not as general as our mathlib versions. Doing things more generally than it needs for its current goal is something I think is currently hard for these AIs.</p>",
