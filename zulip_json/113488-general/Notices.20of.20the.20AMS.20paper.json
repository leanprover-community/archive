The way I see it given that math-mode is the less readable to humans part of a TeX document, that makes it more analogous to term mode in some ways. (I see later you draw the comparison again and do mention term mode with a harder to read example, I feel like  you are using the term tactic mode really to mean all non-comment lean code). </p>\n<p>I feel like it would be helpful to say more / give an example early when you say \"The file might contain errors,<br>\nfor example perhaps a proof in the file is incomplete<br>\nor incorrect, or a definition is not specified precisely<br>\nenough.\" of a specific sort of way a proof can be incorrect people can relate to, \"e.g. not all hypotheses are satisfied of a theorem that is applied, or some cases have not been checked\"</p>\n<p>\"Suffice it to say\" seems like a typo in section 2.</p>\n<p>\"open function -- giving us access to the concept of injectivity\" - also seems like a needless complication at this point in the article (surely composition of injectivity is in the function namespace anyway ;) )</p>\n<p>Probably you are aware or this is a placeholder but at the end of 3.1 there is an errant sentence \"A Proposition is any true/false statement.\"</p>\n<p>\"Probably many of us are familiar with Sudoku\"...
