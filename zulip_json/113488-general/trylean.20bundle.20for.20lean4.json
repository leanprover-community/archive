But I am used to dealing with mathematicians with slow Windows machines who have no git, no python, and have literally never seen a command line and have no idea how to navigate to a given directory within it. Right now my solution for these people is just to direct them to gitpod (and to ensure that all my projects are gitpod-ready); the only real objection I've heard to that solution is that you have to make an account on github (and then make ssh keys work, and soon you'll also have to set up 2FA, if you want to actually do anything like saving your work easily).</p>",
