When one first gets <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint\">leanblueprint</a> up and running, the blueprint obtained doesn't look like much the ones linked to in the Readme. In particular, one doesn't get the sidebar enumerating sections. Only after digging for a while did I find out that my install might be correct (I thought for sure there had to be some error because my blueprint didn't look like the ones linked to). How does one go about changing the style to match the blueprints in the links more closely? Would it be good to have the style include a sidebar as default? </p>\n<p>I guess I should ping <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span>  with this. Thanks, in advance, for any help!</p>",
