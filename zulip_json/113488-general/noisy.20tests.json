I believe that this restriction was lifted in <code>Mathlib4</code>, due to the fact that the tactics that would allow to catch \"noise\" and make sure that it was of the right kind were unavailable.</p>\n<p>Now, <code>#guard_msgs</code> allows for such catching and I thought that I would try out one PR where I add <code>#guard_msgs</code> for all the tests that contain a sorry: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6868\">#6868</a>.  The test files are still noisy after this, just a little less!</p>\n<p>However, if there is interest in going back to quiet tests, then this should be a step forward!</p>",
