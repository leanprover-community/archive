My advisor and I are thinking about formalizing the Bollobás-Thomason Theorem in LEAN. My question is, how feasible is this given the current state of mathlib? Does mathlib have all of the tools needed to formalize this theorem or is there a lot missing? I noticed, for example, that there does not seem to be a definition for the Erdős–Rényi random graph model in mathlib. I would appreciate any advice. Thanks!</p>",
