For using mathlib you can add </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">require</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">mathlib</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">git</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>to lakefile.lean under the root directory of your project and then run <code>lake exe cache get</code> in some terminal under the root directory of the project. After the cache downloaded successfully you should able to import files from mathlib expected. Thanks!</p>",
