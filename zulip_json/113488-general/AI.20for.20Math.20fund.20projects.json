Our first priority on the Mathlib side is to add definitions for the objects that show up in the LMFDB (focused at first on elliptic curves, number fields and modular forms).  We have a newly created (rough) <a href=\"https://cbirkbeck.github.io/LeanBridge/\">blueprint</a>, built out of the LMFDB's <a href=\"https://www.lmfdb.org/knowledge/?category=nf\">knowls</a> and will be working to flesh that out over the coming months.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in getting involved, check out the <a href=\"https://www.renaissancephilanthropy.org/scalable-theorem-proving\">announcement</a> for more details and join us at <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"530229\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/530229-LMFDB\">#LMFDB</a>!</p>",
