But even if Isabelle could sledgehammer the proofs away, I think usability-wise lean takes the cake. The fact that it is and works like a programming language makes it ridiculously easy for me to reason about what's happening and what to modularise away, compared to Isabelle, which often feels like some ancient sorcery ritual (especially for program generation stuff). There are some verification related things I am doing in lean, that I first tried on TLA+ and Isabelle. Lean simply makes more intuitive sense for the goal I am trying to achieve.</p>",
