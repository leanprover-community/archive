What you get with L is in my eyes the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You get a single theorem for computability (namely, a definition of a lambda term that compute the function for all values).  Properties like complexity, termination, etc. are then theorems about this lambda term.  This also works for higher-order function without any friction.  (To be fair, we could also do this with partial recursive functions and maybe turing machines---but I'm not sure if there's a canonical turing machine that suffices for complexity analysis).</li>\n<li>It's obvious how to represent data in L.  <code>List.take 10 xs</code> has <code>O(10)</code> runtime, no matter what the type of the elements in <code>xs</code> is.  Depending on how lists / function arguments / return values are represented in a Turing machine, this might entail copying the elements, the whole list, etc. (Though we could also solve that with other computational models, like random-access machines.)</li>\n</ol>",

I have not looked into it that deep, but as far as I understood,  you can arrange things such that one can compose \"online\" algorithms, for instance one can think of addition as a function that traverses two binary representations and, on the fly,. returns the stream of bits of the sum. If the function called on that result directly \"consumes\" the output (or, more explicitly, pauses and resumes the computation of the bits as needed), one can add numbers inside an log(n) algorithm.</p>\n<p>Another approach (which I think is more common) is to represent numbers not as numbers, but as algorithms that, given an index i, return the i-the bit of the number. This allows to represent numbers of size up to n in log(n) space (But only a constant amount of them, because the code has to exists in the program itself). As long as one is only interested in space, this very inefficient representation does work.</p>\n<p>But this inability of writing down intermediate results explicitly makes formalizations of space really complicated.</p>",

(But of course it would be great if it would!) To implement on a Turing machine, you'd probably need some kind of environment implemented with pointers, and pointers can grow linear-logarithmically instead of just linearly. At least, that's what happens with lambda calculus and why for e.g. the full lambda calculus space complexity is still an open problem. For RAM machines, defining space is also way more subtle  than one might think (that was the content of the first paper by Slot and van Emde Boas, where they came up with the conjecture that all reasonable models of computation can simulate each other with polynomial overhead in time and constanct-factor (i.e. linear) overhead in space</p>",

If it is to just prove variants of complexity results in your model, then this will certainly do. There will have to be suitable adaptations of statements. For instance, in the time/space hierarchy theorems. If however your goal is to build a larger library of results which the TCS community finds useful, and builds upon further, then TM and RAM are unavoidable. There are relatively few  uniform translations of complexity results from one model to another, and usually one can do better for various classes of problems. Most people in this field care about them. There was a similar discussion in another thread.</p>",

Also I have some concerns about how cardinality is handled, I've had to add noncomputable to indicate finiteness, hopefully if I have a fintype I can avoid it, but it does make me worried (I don't think berg's lemma holds on infinite graphs for example).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think ideally for the initial algorithms we explore, the math exists (i.e. provably correctness) but the complexity is the missing piece.

The golfing is rather than having each memory bank have n data and n more memory banks, each memory bank only has 1 data, but this is just pushing things one level down because the n more banks 1 data is n data.<br>\nAll data starts zeroed out (and I use has_zero rather than inhabited for this reason), I allow arbitrary binary operations and random-access through any (constant) number of memory banks. I figure we can always put a filter over the instructions later if someone doesn't want that.<br>\nAs <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"466334\">@Shreyas Srinivas</span> suggested, I've added a \"call\" instruction which takes one of these memory banks and limits the call's visibility inside of it. When you run out of instructions the function returns (and this works at the top level to create the final \"result\"). This makes proving composability easier, which I've proved here (<a href=\"https://github.com/calcu16/lean_complexity/blob/main/src/membank/encoding/basic.lean\">https://github.com/calcu16/lean_complexity/blob/main/src/membank/encoding/basic.lean</a>) - the proof is messy right now.<br>\nOne tricky thing is allowing recursion, right now recurse is essentially creates a do-while around the current function and calls continue. I'm not the happiest about this, and am open to suggestions. I've considered a giant map of function names (numeric or otherwise), but I feel like that would impede composability since you'd have to limit the scope, possibly deal with alpha-equivalence etc.</p>\n<p>I currently allow any type as the memory bank, but I think bool or finset 2 is all that is required. However, leaving it general does allow infinite data types such as natural numbers or even reals which could be fun to think about (especially by constraining the binary op).</p>",

Also I could use the hidden form instead, it just makes the proofs more annoying since I can't rw as easily.</p>\n<p>That being said the ability to #eval has been cool, and nat is slightly easier to work with when testing then fin, so it would be nice to have it working.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to achieve this?</p>\n<p>One thing I've noticed is a lot of things that I would normally mathematically define as quotients (such as integers and rationals) are actually defined as dependent types of the canonical member instead.
