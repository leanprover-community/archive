In my case, I guess I will just use a virtual machine. I will just spinnup a VMware Machine with UBUNTU or DEBIAN ... It should work. Once I get everything installed, then maybe I should share it. That way all that one has to do is download the machine, and your good to go! Do you think people would like that?</p>",
