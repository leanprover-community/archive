Now Streamlit is very convenient and it provides a <a href=\"https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text/st.code\">st.code</a> API which can do the same, with syntax highlighting of any language present in <a href=\"https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter/blob/master/AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES_PRISM.MD\">react-syntax-highlighter</a>.<br>\nI found out that Lean4 has this <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/highlightjs-lean\">highlightjs-lean</a>, which is great.<br>\nSo I had made an issue on GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter/issues/587\">react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter #587</a> so that lean4 can be added to the list and hence ill be able to use it on streamlit, but the repo seems unmaintained.</p>\n<p>I would like to know if there is any other way/any ideas on how to get lean4 syntax highlighting on react-syntax-highligher or atleast streamlit.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
