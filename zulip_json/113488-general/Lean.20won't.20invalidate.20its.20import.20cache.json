Every now and then, I add some new definitions to <code>B</code>, and then restart <code>A</code> so it can see the changes. Up until last night, this just worked. However, last night I got Lean into a state where Lean refused to notice that <code>B</code> had changed: not when I restarted the file, not when I restarted the server, not even when I restarted the editor (Cursor Nightly) or the whole computer. </p>\n<p>Eventually, I managed to get it to compile by removing a blank line from the top of file <code>A</code>, which suddenly seemed to make it 'wake up'. However, the problem has just reoccurred and even 'real' changes to <code>A</code>s imports aren't making it rebuild its imports. </p>\n<p>I'm currently in the process of nuking <code>.lake</code> and redownloading the cache, but even if that works, I'd like some assistance debugging what's going on.</p>",
