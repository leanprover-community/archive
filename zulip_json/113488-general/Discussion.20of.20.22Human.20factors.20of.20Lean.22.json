I have two comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(~10min) Most of your UI suggestions for the Natural Number Game seem like clear improvements, e.g. not showing locked tactics/lemmas. The one I am not sure about is hiding lemma names entirely and replacing them by their types. This is because mathlib has a very rigid <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html\">naming convention</a>, and in practice experienced mathlib users know this well enough to be able to guess theorem names without looking them up. One might question the sensibility of this practice, but insofar as it is established right now, you might want understanding the convention to be one of the learning outcomes of NNG, in which case you do want to show theorem names as well (though I agree that the types could be displayed more prominently than one-click-away).</li>\n<li>(~40min) Regarding the reification of information visualization principles into algorithms that produce the tactic state display shown in the infoview, while the order of local assumptions is partly chronological, it is also constrained by dependency order. That is, assumptions which don't depend on each other tend to be ordered by whichever-came-first (and could be moved past each other for purposes of information grouping), but you cannot move an assumption that depends on another one before that one; or rather, you could, but it might be quite confusing to see <code>h : SomeProperty r</code> appear first and then <code>r : SomeType</code> appear later.</li>\n</ul>",

These kinds of academic handbooks where researchers contribute individual chapters are necessarily chaotic. They resemble conference proceedings more than a coherent book. The chapters look good, but I doubt this book is best as a first-time introduction to these concepts.

On average, we just have less useful rigorously-validated knowledge about learning. Following <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=3a701e9899d2aa978bcfded6d9adc0537b5e1b57\">\"Delivering Cognitive Psychology to HCI\"</a>, I find that learning science is most useful when it gives me concepts/vocabulary for thinking more deeply/precisely about learning and pedagogy.

It's hard to turn off the part of the brain that says \"well yes but I have no intuition for whether the concept is applicable relative to other things\". I think you touched on something which referenced this in your talk when talking about how studies are usually about broccoli :) or something thereabouts.</p>\n<p>But for instance, I found it hard not to be distracted when you proposed hiding theorem names in NNG  by \"it seems not obvious to me whether that might improve how fluidly someone moves through NNG but then perhaps they come out less familiar with the naming convention, which it seems like the NNG is trying to teach as a hidden skill by showing those\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Totally. That's why it's good to learn from psychology in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather ideas that inspire you to build new things, or design existing things in new ways.</li>\n<li>Gather methods that empower you to evaluate the things you're building.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The latter is essential for testing whether ideas successfully transfer out of their original context and into yours. In the NNG case, I agree that hiding theorem names by default will probably impact a learner's ultimate understanding of Lean naming conventions. (I addressed this <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Discussion.20of.20.22Human.20factors.20of.20Lean.22/near/464745951\">a bit earlier</a>.) I intuitively believe that trade-off is worth it, but that's an empirical question which could be evaluated.</p>\n<p>More broadly, any sufficiently complex artifact (Lean, NNG, etc.) is built out of thousands or even millions of tiny design decisions. You never get to rigorously explore the design space for every decision. The best you can do is sway your priors in a direction you hope is productive!</p>",

In terms of communication it would be really nice if you actively communicated your analysis and suggestions with the relevant parties, i.e. for the Lean environment, start Zulip topics about individual things or write on the relevant github repos, which are all open-source and should almost all be directly linked from the tool itself. It's somewhat unusual to be told by a third party to go watch a video when the suggestions (in particular the ones about the NNG) could basically be a one-sentence feature request each.</p>\n<p>The suggestions are very valid though and certainly apprechiated!</p>\n<p>One comment on the \"locked tactics\": originally they weren't displayed (as you suggest) and then it's been decided to add them as to convey the user's progress as they play. So having a github issue about how they negatively impact the learning experience would be useful in order to bring this up again for discussion!

The primary goal of the talk is to use these suggestions <em>as a lens</em> by which to understand the general principles of human-centered design. I specifically didn't file feature requests because the ideas are all preliminary / underspecified, and in my experience in open source, it can be annoying to have people raise extremely broad suggestions that pollute your Github issues. (But I am happy to file feature requests if you'd like!)</p>\n<p>Re: locked tactics, it makes sense why they are there. It's important to observe I am taking a strictly utilitarian approach in my suggestions, which doesn't really consider the affective components of design decisions (e.g., fun, satisfaction, anticipation, etc.). It's also valid to say \"we're going to do something that trades-off utility for fun.\"</p>",
