But I think that the availability for Lean3 is close to the availability for Lean4. (Maybe I should improve it after referring to the existing highlight file for Lean3.)<br>\nI just found that <code>begin</code> was not highlighted. And after trying to highlight the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/tutorials\">tutorials</a>, I found that there were still some frequently-used tactics missing.<br>\nNow the highlighting file is updated with <code>begin</code> keyword and more tactics. (In fact, I don't know whether it is a good idea to hardcode the tactics. I am trying to make the highlight look like VSCode's, where the highlighting for tactics is semantic but not hardcoded.)</p>",
