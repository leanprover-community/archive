The project is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/import-graph\">leanprover-community/import-graph</a>.</p>\n<p>Quickly glancing at the code, I think it could very well make sense to merge the lean code of the two projects. The Lean code in this project seems quite concise.</p>\n<p>I also see no obstructions that <code>lake exe graph</code> (with some args) could create this <code>.json</code> file, which is used for the dynamic web graph, on demand.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"674496\">@Patrik Cihal</span> I'll dm you to ask about your plans and maybe I can also help combining the functionalities of the two.</p>",
