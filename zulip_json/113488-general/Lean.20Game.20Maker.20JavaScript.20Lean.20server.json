I was able to create the .zip file but I'm unsure about the next steps. The <a href=\"https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker/blob/master/USAGE.md\">USAGE.md</a> tells me to use a JavaScript Lean server and I tried to this as it is explained in this <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js\">repository</a>. I'm running into some issues however, so I was wondering if you guys did this before and could tell me where to go from here. </p>\n<p>Also I'm using Ubuntu with WSL and often get the message UNC-Paths not supported which causes some problems, since it defaults to the windows directory. Should I use a virtual machine instead?</p>\n<p>Sorry if I posted this in the wrong place!</p>",
