Our formalisation interests were quite close: he was moving forward the order library for applications to functional analysis and I was honored to review his PRs on the various order topologies he needed. His <a href=\"https://github.com/mans0954\">GitHub page</a> still proudly displays his mathlib achievements. I will remember Chris as a very kind person and prompt contributor, who had become valued for his expertise and social approach.</p>",
