These AIs are working in a void, with neither access to current information (unless you see evidence they are doing web searches), and without the ability to verify their work.</p>\n<p>If you were using Claude Code, on the other hand, and asked it \"Please find and read the current documentation on <code>lakefile.toml</code>, and then create one for me\", I'm pretty sure it would give an excellent answer (in fact, it would very likely run <code>lake build</code> for you without even being asked, and iterate if something went wrong). (Of course, this is strictly a worse procedure than running <code>lake new</code> --- a human has already thought carefully about what your <code>lakefile.toml</code> should look like!)</p>\n<p>But if you ask for a <code>lakefile.toml</code> from a webpage based AI, you should expect unverified hallucination.</p>",
