You can apply this manually by adding another breakpoint at the second error, and running <code>this.ERRNO_CODES = {}</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js/pull/58\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js/pull/58</a>.  You can apply this manually by sticking a breakpoint at the line where the first error occurs, and running <code>Module.FS.createFolder = Module.FS.createPath</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these applied, it now complains that it can't find <code>library/init/default.lean</code>; indeed, the filesystem only has<code>library/init/default.olean</code> (you can test with <code>Module.FS.lookupPath('/library/init/default.olean')</code></p>",
