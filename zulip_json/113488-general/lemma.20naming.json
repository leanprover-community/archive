This would just be noise in the library. We shouldn't prove <code>theorem add_sq_eq_sq : Pythagorean_Theorem</code> or whatever. This just adds a useless layer of indirection, makes things hard for any metaprograms that work at the syntactic eq level, etc. So <code>def Pythagorean_Theorem : Prop := a^2 + b^2 = c^2</code> would never be used in the library.</p>",
