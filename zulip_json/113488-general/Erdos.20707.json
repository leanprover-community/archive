The authors are especially grateful to the Mathlib community for their unified library of mathematics in Lean4. Even with this extensive library, we found it surprisingly painful to successfully write proofs in Lean, so we also thank OpenAI for producing a large language model (namely, ChatGPT with GPT-5) that is capable of meeting a human mathematician halfway (or at least partway).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the intro:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The resulting formal proof is thousands of lines, nearly all of which were written by ChatGPT. Accordingly, we believe that ChatGPT is properly an author of the formal proof accompanying this paper. Unfortunately, large language models are known to hallucinate and otherwise produce incorrect results, so we would not be able to trust this proof unless it was in a formal language. Therefore, we believe Lean is also an author, or perhaps ChatGPT and Lean may be credited together</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/zG3cyi9lLCuP4K-7IUXweWGv/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-12.38.47PM.png\">Screenshot 2025-10-22 at 12.38.47 PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/zG3cyi9lLCuP4K-7IUXweWGv/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-12.38.47PM.png\" title=\"Screenshot 2025-10-22 at 12.38.47 PM.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1000x232\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/zG3cyi9lLCuP4K-7IUXweWGv/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-12.38.47PM.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>And they note that you don't have to fear that they vibe-proved the wrong theorem, because the theorem statement they are interested in has already been formalized in GDM's \"Formal Conjectures\" repository!</p>",

ChatGPT indeed didn't find this.  It did find <code>card_modEq_card_fixedPoints</code> which says that the cardinality of the fixed point set and the set are equal for a p-group action (which is what was used in the end, for an action of the two-element group).</p>\n<p>But for this approach, we likely would still have had some trouble with ChatGPT hooking up all the pipes, as we did with <code>card_modEq_card_fixedPoints</code>.  Our hypotheses were of the form</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hff</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∀</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hno</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∀</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">≠</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and ChatGPT wasn't the best at translating that into other forms (like the p-group).  I do think <code>Perm</code> wouldn't be too bad.  A result with <code>Involutive</code> would have been good.  I think it says something that the result wasn't easy to find.</p>\n<p>(One thing I also tried was looking at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/alexjbest/1fcc06a67f4d56275f99c44037bb1b6d\">https://gist.github.com/alexjbest/1fcc06a67f4d56275f99c44037bb1b6d</a> because I knew the mod-2 result was used within Zagier's proof but that was in Lean 3 and ChatGPT couldn't translate into Lean 4 correctly.)</p>",
