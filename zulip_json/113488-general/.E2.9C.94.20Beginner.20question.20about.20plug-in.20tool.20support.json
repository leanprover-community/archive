I am further investigating \"translations\" between the representation language and other formal languages to yield natural language input interfaces to LEAN 4, Isabelle, ATPs (TPTP), ..., and improve on the data exchange between ITPs/ATPs.</p>\n<p>I will eventually have tools which perform these steps and wonder, how LEAN 4-understandable data can be sent to LEAN 4 for processing?</p>\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> Is it correct to think of a \"plug-in tool and API design and integration into LEAN 4\", or is there a dedicated way for such increments in LEAN 4, or else ... ? <br>\n(Couldn't find anything about plug-in/extension/... in the documentation)</p>",
