For example, least squares regression is both a mathematical object and a core ML algorithm. Should we split the formalization, or is there a preferred home for these in the Lean ecosystem?<br>\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and any relevant examples or conventions. Here's a PR I opened: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/cslib/pull/375\">https://github.com/leanprover/cslib/pull/375</a></p>",
