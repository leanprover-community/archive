The formalization contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A definition of geometric logic and its deduction rules. This is roughly intuitionistic first order logic extended with infinite joints, but without implications and foralls.</li>\n<li>An interpretation of any geometric logic formula into a <a href=\"https://github.com/kyoDralliam/model-theory-topos/blob/ecb36264e0b5283ffac50bb8db3d977128417ab6/ModelTheoryTopos/Geometric/RegularCategory.lean#L38\">geometric category</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kyoDralliam/model-theory-topos/blob/ecb36264e0b5283ffac50bb8db3d977128417ab6/ModelTheoryTopos/Geometric/Structure.lean#L364\">Soundness</a>: Any derivation in geometric logic leads to a correct theorem of the corresponding interpretation in a geometric category.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Future work will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Showing that Grothendieck topoi are geometric categories.</li>\n<li>Explore how the internal logic machinery can be used to prove things about the current Lean definitions of, e.g., sheaves of rings, sheaves of modules, schemes, etc.</li>\n<li>Explore if <a href=\"https://voidma.in/assets/papers/2025nawrocki_certifying_proof_assistant_synthetic_mathematics_lean.pdf\"><code>SynthLean</code></a> or a similar mechanism can be used to reflect existing Lean proofs into the internal language.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any feedback is very much appreaciated!</p>\n<p>This is a joint project with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"261023\">@Kyod</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"776892\">@Yiming Xu</span>.
