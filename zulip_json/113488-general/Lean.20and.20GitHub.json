I was able to set up a new project using <code>mathlib</code> on my local machine, but I want to save and host my project on GitHub as well. Is there a way to do this or a tutorial I can follow on the Lean documentations?</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Welcome. I interpreted your question as being \"I'm new to Git + GitHub\" so I wrote the below. Not sure if that was the intention:</p>\n<p>Git and GitHub are in some ways 1) a rabbithole (there's a huge amount you <em>could</em> learn about them) and 2) totally general and not only useful for Lean + Mathlib + math.<br>\nThe two of those mean that I think your best bet is to take a simple introductory tutorial for GitHub and try that, and if you need to learn anything after that you'll pick it up afterwards as you go.<br>\nHere are 2 resources for that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world\">https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git\">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first one is the first \"how to use GitHub\" tutorial. The second is for VSCode, your editor. Both of those you can likely go through as quickly or slowly as you choose.</p>\n<p>Jeremy's suggestion is I'm sure great if the question was intended to be less introductory and you already kind of know what you want!</p>",
