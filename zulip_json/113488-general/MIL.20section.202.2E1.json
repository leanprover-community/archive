Calculating, there is an exercise that asked me to prove that (a + b) * (a - b) = a ^ 2 - b ^ 2. It says, \"The following exercise is a little more challenging. You can use the theorems listed underneath\", and it lists the theorems pow_two, mul_sub, add_mul, add_sub, sub_sub, and add_zero. The wording for the exercise makes it seem like that it should be possible to complete the proof with only the listed theorems, but I was unable to find a proof that didn't use mul_comm and sub_self. (In particular, it isn't clear how to simplify b * a - a * b without these rules.) </p>\n<p>Is there a solution to this problem that doesn't use mul_comm and sub_self, or should these theorems be added to the list?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>P.S. Is this the right channel for us to post future MIL questions to?</p>",
