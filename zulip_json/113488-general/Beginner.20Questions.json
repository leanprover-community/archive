How do I attribute a value to it (let's say, 3)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first thing to understand about lean is that it is a <em>functional programming language</em>. If you are used to a more traditional imperative programming language, like C, Java, Python, etc, then there is a bit of culture shock to be had. The big thing to know is that there are no \"variables* in lean in the sense meant by this word in imperative languages. (My professor always said this was a bad name for them and preferred the term \"assignable\" for C/Java style mutable memory locations.) In lean, variables are things that you can substitute values for, but their values never change from the time they are declared. In an imperative language you would call these immutable variables, but there are no mutable variables in lean.</p>\n<p>To declare a variable and give it a value, you can use <code>let</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>def f (x : nat) : nat :=\nlet y := 3 in ...\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Here <code>f</code> is a function with an input variable of type <code>nat</code>, and inside the body of the function I've declared a variable <code>y</code> (also of type <code>nat</code>) with value <code>3</code>.</p>",

This is done in the first two lines, with <code>| [] :=</code> and <code>| (y :: ys) :=</code>. This says what to do if the list is empty, and what to do if it is nonempty with head <code>y</code> and tail <code>ys</code>. Defining the function this way automatically takes care of \"knowing when I've reached the end of a list\", because you can't even get the value from a list unless you are already in the nonempty case - the nonempty check and value retrieval happen at the same time.</p>",

This is because unlike most pointer based languages, there is no \"universal null\" value in all types - the values of a type are all explicitly determined by the type. So if you define a variable of type <code>int</code>, then it must contain an integer value, maybe <code>0</code> or <code>42</code> or something but \"unassigned\" is not an option. <code>let k := int</code> actually declares <code>k</code> to be a variable of type <code>Type</code> with value <code>int</code>, which is probably not what you want.</p>",

In this case, since the type of the function is <code>is_equal : list char → list char → bool</code>, there are two arguments, both lists of chars, and so each case should include two variables, possibly broken into cases. In my code snippet I broke into all four cases, but you can combine some of them with wildcards <code>_</code>, depending on the function you are defining.

First open a completely new file called scratch.lean and let's see if we can isolate your question. Make this as the only line:</p>\n<p><code>definition X := some 0</code></p>\n<p>It works! </p>\n<p>[technical note: This isn't always the case -- sometimes the thing you're trying to understand might rely on some file being imported or some namespace being open and you'll have to resort to right-clicking -- see later.]</p>\n<p>Now we have <code>X</code> we can see what this <code>some</code> command really is -- it's defined in the root namespace and is in core lean, so it's probably important. </p>\n<p>Now we can write stuff like</p>\n<p><code>#check X</code></p>\n<p>to see that <code>X</code> is a term of type <code>option ℕ</code>. So it looks like <code>option</code> is a function which eats <code>ℕ</code>. What is the type of <code>ℕ</code>? We just check with</p>\n<p><code>#check ℕ</code></p>\n<p>and we see that <code>ℕ</code> has type <code>Type</code>. So <code>option</code> is a function which eats something of type <code>Type</code>. We can look at what <code>option</code> is with</p>\n<p><code>#check option </code></p>\n<p>and we see it's a function from <code>Type</code> to <code>Type</code> (just ignore the universes, you can worry about these later). So <code>some 0</code> is a term of type <code>option ℕ</code>which has type <code>Type</code>. So that's where <code>some 0</code> lives in the tree of terms, types and universes.</p>\n<p>[Pro tip: always be checking there are no red underlines in your code. Sometimes random typos which you don't bother to fix can have weird consequences later on. Learn how to use <code>sorry</code> to fix red errors in half-written code]</p>\n<p>We didn't look at any definitions yet, we just looked at the types of everything in sight. Everything has a type, and <code>#check x</code> tells you the type of <code>x</code>. Here is a simple picture of the entire type theory of Lean. There are six kinds of things. There are two universes, <code>Type</code> and <code>Prop</code>. A type is something of type <code>Type</code>, and a term is something of type <code>α</code> for <code>α</code> a type. A proposition is something of type <code>Prop</code>, and a proof is something of type <code>H</code> for <code>H</code> a proposition. That's it. The <code>Type</code> stuff is where computer programs live. <code>Prop</code> is where theorems and proofs live. So <code>some 0</code> is a computable thing, it's a term of type <code>option ℕ : Type</code>. </p>\n<p>Next let's actually unravel the definitions. Right-click on <code>some</code> in VS Code and select <code>Go to definition</code> (or left-click and press F12). A new file will open called <code>core.lean</code> and you'll be taken to about line 279 where you'll see that <code>option α</code> is an inductive type with two constructors: <code>none</code> and <code>some val</code> with <code>val : α</code>. So in abstracta your question is answered -- <code>some</code> is a constructor which takes <code>n : ℕ</code> and returns <code>some n : option ℕ</code>. We can just check that with </p>\n<p><code>#check some</code></p>\n<p>and the answer...looks a bit messy. It's clearly some kind of function, but there are question marks. If you don't like those <code>?M_1</code> things, you could use the following trick:</p>\n<p><code>#check @some</code></p>\n<p>which works with functions and which might produce nicer output. Now we see that <code>some</code> is actually a Pi type.</p>\n<p>Here's a gist with all those commands in. One of the fiddly little VS Code options on the right is \"show the output of all the <code>#check</code>s at once\"; that might be the one you want here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/455709bfd5d8fed57f5e4321481adf5b\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/455709bfd5d8fed57f5e4321481adf5b\">https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/455709bfd5d8fed57f5e4321481adf5b</a></p>\n<p>If you get stuck at some point, send the entire file as a gist (just google for how to do it) or, if it's got quite big, just a minimal working example of your question. It's much easier for experts to answer questions with the full file in front of them. Even experts make silly mistakes sometimes, which others can spot instantly. Actually, sometimes I find my own silly mistakes when I am making the minimal working example. And did I mention to make sure there are no errors in your file?</p>\n<p>So that's <code>option</code>, and how to ask if you get stuck along the way. But if you want some more insight as to what the point of this type is, or perhaps want to know more about what an inductive type is or a Pi type, or what the different kinds of brackets all mean (round, squiggly, square), now is the time to go to the docs -- Theorem Proving In Lean is a really good place to look for basic stuff. It's here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/\">https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/</a></p>\n<p>I find the web search functionality really hard to use though; there's a pdf download and I usually search with my pdf viewer and then maybe switch to the html manual later because it looks nicer, if I want to know more. If you want to know more about <code>option</code> then the fourth occurrence of \" option \" in the pdf is the one you want; it's on p101. There you can see a brief description of the point of <code>option</code> and examples of other inductive types which have similar structures. I wish I had learnt this method earlier -- it took a while to dawn on me that you could just work everything out by right clicking and figuring out if you were a term or a type, a proof or a proposition.</p>\n<p>You also need to learn a kind of filter -- stuff you can just ignore for the time being.  Stuff like typeclasses, <code>opt_param</code>/<code>out_param</code>, <code>[stuff in brackets]</code> and universes, you can start to worry about them later. Universes are to do with subtle set-theoretic issues like avoiding Russell's Paradox, and the other stuff is technical computer science stuff which you can just treat as magic for the time being. [Typeclasses are some crazy computer science generalisation of notation overloading]</p>",

You came to my talk yesterday, right? <code>alpha -&gt; beta -&gt; gamma</code> is a type, and you make terms of that type using <code>lambda</code>. After the <code>lambda</code> you'd better take a term of type alpha and then a term of type beta, and then you need to return a term of type gamma. So now hopefully you can get your terms sorted out. For products however, you need to learn the notation. The type is <code>\\alpha \\times \\beta</code> so now you need to know the constructor and the eliminators, which is a fancy way of saying that you need to know how to get something of type <code>alpha x beta</code> from <code>a : alpha</code> and <code>b : beta</code> (that's the constructor for the product) and then you also need to know how to get the things of type alpha and beta from the thing of type <code>alpha x beta</code> -- those are the eliminators. So that's three different pieces of notation -- one for making the product type (that's \\times), one for the constructor (that's pointy brackets) and one for the elminators (that's the <code>.1</code> and <code>.2</code> notation). A year ago all of these were floating around in my head and I'd just try any of them until something worked. But now I realise that if you keep everything straight then it all starts fitting into place. The pointy brackets are often used for constructors, the dots are often used for eliminators (I hope they are called eliminators, I'm no expert) and the notation for the types depends on the type but is something you pick up as you go along.</p>",
