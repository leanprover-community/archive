Proofs/Dependent Type programming can be very intimidating. It is good to see that there are people in the space that are struggling, but still completing some projects and that everyone here isn't born an expert, like it might seem. We hope that our streams help a little to make it seem more approachable.</p>\n<p>Btw don't expect more than 1 live viewer per stream, this is a niche subject. But you can expect a few hundred views after uploading to youtube, which is pretty amazing.</p>\n<p>Please do start a live stream, there needs to be more.<br>\nRemember to also upload your content to youtube after, you would be surprised about the great people you meet.  The thing with any skill, is to just start and if you persist you will get better. If you don't become good, no one will notice and if you do become good, no one will remember how you started. And if you are critical of yourself, then maybe that is worth challenging.</p>\n<p>Setup: It doesn't have to be complicated, we did crazy stuff with setup up OBS on AWS with special mics, it just ended up being annoying and interrupting our coding. There is nothing wrong with starting with just using your laptop mic and Zoom, which can stream to Twitch and then download the video from Twitch after. How about making incremental improvements only if you need to.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you just want to ask questions, Zulip is really the best place. People here answer very quickly and are very helpful, you might as well be on a live stream, but better.</p>",
