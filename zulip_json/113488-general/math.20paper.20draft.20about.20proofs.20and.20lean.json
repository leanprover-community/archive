Examples of impactful projects using classical logic were some of the recent high-profile mathematics projects (getting featured in Nature, Quanta etc). So yes, it's not about people: constructivists are not hard to find, you can find them in the theory groups in many computer science departments. My impression is that many of them cannot use Lean for lots of reasons, not just the fact that some core tactics use classical logic. For example the univalence axiom is false in Lean, and this is very unlikely to change any time soon.</p>",
