This would make the barrier to entry easier since you wouldn't have to download anything -- sort of similar to Overleaf versus a local LaTeX editor. I'm a math student playing around with building webapps, and was thinking that could be an interesting side project. Just curious, thanks!</p>",

The webapp I was thinking would be a step further than that one. You would be able to login to it and have your previous work (among other customized things).</p>",
