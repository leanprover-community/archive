I think that investigating the newly built-in <code>Grind.CommRing.Poly</code> type and the automations it provides will make the best way to bring our kind of automation to Mathlib more clear. I also imagine there is a lot of further work on<code>Poly</code> itself that we could contribute to Mathlib!</p>",
