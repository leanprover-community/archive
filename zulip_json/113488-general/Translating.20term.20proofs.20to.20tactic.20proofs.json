Of course, one can always just add <code>by exact</code> before the term, but this is cheating. What I am imagining is that if the term is a lambda expression, one translates it into <code>intro</code>, if it contains <code>▸</code>, one translates it into <code>rw</code>,  and the function application is <code>apply</code>, ... So in the end, from a term proof, you will get a tactic proof with lots of <code>apply</code>, <code>intro</code>, and some <code>rw</code>, <code>have</code>, <code>let</code>.</p>",

My friends and I have been working on an auto-translation project using LLM to convert mathlib theorems into natural language. We discovered that the LLM performs well on tactic proofs, as the stepwise logic is clearly indicated by the tactic names and the proof states between tactics. However, long term proofs are hard; they are difficult to read even for humans. Therefore, I am keen on developing a tool that can first translate term proofs into tactic proofs, allowing us to apply the same method we used for tactic proofs.</p>",
