My subscriptions are getting out of hand, they're like some people's sport channel cable bills.</p>\n<p>I'm new to this , but not sleeping much trying to become a Centaur programmer, in the sense popularized by Gary Kasparov after he recovered from his defeat by IBM's Big Blue. My sense is that these very months are an inflection point, and no one actually has any idea how to best use these tools. One principle: You're not talking to an alien intelligence; you're  talking to yourself. The quality of the planning document prompts dramatically affects whether AI flails like a freshman or knocks out code like Bill Joy.</p>\n<p>I've been experimenting with coding small test math programs in three or four languages at once, in either Cursor or Windsurf using a common prompt. When everything works, ask AI to rewrite the prompt, then take it to the other editor and start again from scratch.</p>\n<p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet understands my iPad math drawings, and an astonishing amount of mathematics and strategies for combinatorial search and such. While Cursor is slightly clumsier than WIndsurf, Cursor lets you use Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the AI assistant. Windsurf's assistant is in-house, remarkable at programming when there's a decent training corpus, but just not as smart as Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I'm forced to use Cursor more, when I need Claude's comprehension.</p>\n<p>A middle ground is to use standalone Claude, away from an editor, to flesh out over several hours a very careful specification prompt. Then in most languages either system can emit correct code basically on the first try.</p>\n<p>This suggests a middle ground between unreadable and uncheckable conventional math papers, and the formal proofs considered here: We should publish AI prompts that have been battle-tested to yield AI-assisted working code, that pose as conventional papers for those mathematicians still trapped in amber.</p>\n<p>I came here hoping for help with a tragic realization: This year's AI simply isn't smart enough to use Lean 4 as a general purpose programming language. The training corpus shouldn't matter: AI taught itself the game of Go from just the rules, and devised idioms that blew away humans. AI should teach us how to use Lean 4 as a general purpose language.</p>\n<p>This must be our fault. We write documentation for humans, when we should be writing Centaur documentation for humans and AI.</p>",
