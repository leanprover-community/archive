Many of our tactics can cover infinitely large theories, you will not be able to avoid tactics indefinitely. The solution for this type of stuff could instead be a tactic like hint (iirc that's the name?) Which tries out many tactics and sees if one of them succeeds. If we wanted to make this more peformant we could additionally inform a hint style tactic with \"triggers\" that make it try certain tactics on a goal based on the shape of a goal.</p>\n<p>In general this process can also be improved with the things we are already doing, more automation, standards for the way that a lemma should be named to ease discover ability, tools like loogle. These approaches are proven to work with people that know what they are doing very well already. I don't believe that we should develop a library geared towards people that cannot use these tools but instead make them accessible enough such that they can be used. This can be done throigh improvements on the tools or their integration, the way they are taught to people including good documentation etc.</p>\n<p>Regarding less generalized APIs than mathlib. I'm not an expert on mathlib or large scale formalization at all but providing theories that are powered by mathlib but only expose an educational framework does sound reasonable to me for teaching purposes. However such a project would also need to have high standards. This is because it would be one of the first contact points of many mathematics students with Lean and should thus be very high quality in order to not scare them away.</p>",

For instance, they use <code>simp</code> when they mean <code>norm_num</code>, they try to <code>rw</code> with implications, they think <code>simp</code> will solve anything and everything they deem \"simple\", and all kinds of other problems. So, I could argue that these are \"human nature\", but doing so would lead to scope creep on the part of all these various tactics. This could make them unusably slow, or blur the boundaries between them. This is not good for the ecosystem. Instead, users just need to spend time learning. If they think one tactic is going to save them from any mess, they are sorely mistaken.</li>\n<li>As above, beginners just need to spend time learning, and that's a nontrivial problem; learning takes time and effort. Of course, we want to ease the transition where it makes sense, but I think here more <em>automation</em> is key, not necessarily more <em>lemmas</em>. (Indeed, more lemmas can make searching <em>harder</em>, not easier.)</li>\n<li>In stark contrast to your point that users should be looking for lemmas and not reaching for tactics, <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"260507\">Heather Macbeth</span>'s course / textbook aimed at introducing students to proof takes the exact opposite approach. She has as an explicit goal that students should <em>never</em> need to go searching the library for some lemma, and instead should reach for automation (some of it expressly designed for her course), and she teaches them how to use all of those tactics. Of course, at <em>some</em> point, users will need to appeal to existing theorems, but I think her approach shows that it has the potential to be much later than one might expect. Moreover, by the time they get to that point, they should be reasonably proficient at using Lean and its various tactics, so they won't need to reach for tools like <code>exact?</code> all the time.</li>\n</ol>",

People exploring the project could add tags as responses in a thread (topic), if they would have liked to see them. The worst that could happen when using this search method is that you look at project API that has already been brought to mathlib. Assuming users have checked mathlib or used loogle or moogle before trying this method, this would only result in a small waste of time, which is, in my opinion, better then rewriting existing code.</p>",
