This shouldn't be a problem, as the release candidates should only differ in user interaction and/or linking behaviour. If I have time I'll try to bring everything uniformly to <code>v4.20.0-rc5</code>, but I'd also welcome help doing this in places where people see the need. Running <code>script/release_checklist.py v4.20.0-rc5</code> in the <code>lean4</code> repository may be helpful!</p>",
