One could imagine a division of labor emerging in a large project where some participants (who for whatever reason are not able or willing to use these tools) would speed up their coding by leaving lots of <code>sorry</code>s for routine \"this is obvious\" steps, and having other participants who are expert in these automated tools (and have the GPUs to run them quickly) then come in and try to fill them in efficiently.</p>",

The first thing it'll do is try to transform the facts it has and the target its trying to prove into a mostly first-order problem. Then it'll assume the target's negation, take it as fact, and try to prove a contradiction. Duper will repeatedly take facts that it knows and try to combine them with a variety of rules that can be justified with mostly first order reasoning (though as Patrick said, Duper can do some higher order stuff as well). As Duper chugs along, it'll generate more and more facts until eventually, it derives a contradiction, times out, or 'saturates' (meaning it cannot generate more facts).</p>\n<p>Currently, Duper won't do any special domain-specific reasoning (unless it is explicitly provided the lemmas necessary to do so), it won't do induction, and it only knows facts that are specifically provided to it. As far as the difference between Duper and Aesop, the fundamental approach is pretty different so there are just different problems that the two tactics are well-suited for. I hesitate to make any strong claims of Aesop's capabilities because I'm not a power-user of Aesop, but my anecdotal experience is that I would expect Aesop to be better than Duper on problems that are particularly far from first or higher order logic (e.g. problems centering on inductive types) and I would expect Duper to be better on problems that require a significant amount of native reasoning (e.g. problems that involve combining hypotheses in a variety of ways as opposed to primarily applying rules to the target).</p>",

Then they run that problem against an SMT solver like Z3 and based on its results (these results have no formal proof attached so we cannot trust them) feed a superposition prover (for Isabelle that's metis, for us that will be duper as I understand) with a list of theorems to use.

In commit <code>6b89fca</code> of <code>lean-auto</code>, a change was made to the monomorphization procedure to fail more explicitly in cases where monomorphization is not yet fully supported. The error being thrown by the monomorphization procedure can be seen with <code>set_option duper.throwPortfolioErrors true</code>.</p>\n<p>Although this example is simple as far as the lemma applications are concerned, the type classes involved mean that duper needs the monomorphization procedure to tackle it effectively, and the monomorphization procedure doesn't currently support this problem. So the current duper call is trying to solve the problem with monomorphization (failing because of the error), and then trying to solve the problem without monomorphization (failing because of the type classes involved).</p>",
