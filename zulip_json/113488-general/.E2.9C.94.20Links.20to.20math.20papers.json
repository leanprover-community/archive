All papers and books from elsevier and sciencedirect can also be downloaded for free at other websites such as 3lib, libgen, sci-hub, tpb, and few others. All of them provide direct links to pdf files. However, in some countries, such websites are considered illegal.</p>\n<p>To put it simple, when I reference to a scientific paper or a book, am I allowed to post a direct link to the pdf file, or do I need to provide the official link that leads to the purchasing page? I am talking only about documents that are not intended (by their author) to be publicly accessible.</p>",
