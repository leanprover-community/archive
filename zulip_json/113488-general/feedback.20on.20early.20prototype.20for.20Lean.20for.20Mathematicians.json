The idea is to allow people to hop right on (no installation, no papercuts, just web app) and experiment with nonzero (but easy) math content, in an environment where they have the full freedom to type whatever they want (unlike Natural Number Game which carefully controls what's allowed).</p>\n<p>The user is meant to read each exercise, and click on the \"Open Lean Editor\" button, which pops up a bottom frame preloaded with the desired content for that exercise, running <a href=\"http://live.lean-lang.org\">live.lean-lang.org</a>. When they're satisfied with playing with that exercise, they click the same button to \"Close Lean Editor\", then move on to the next exercise. [This might be interesting to implement also with Mathematics in Lean...]</p>\n<p>Any comments/suggestions would be very welcome! (Perhaps it's better for such to be sent by DM to me, so as not to clog the <code>general</code> discussion?) Thanks!</p>",

I was just looking for more exercises after the natural number games and this proved a great next step (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/rkirov/acea4b8d478a581cbd58190a864bf541\">https://gist.github.com/rkirov/acea4b8d478a581cbd58190a864bf541</a> almost got the first problem solved, but there is an error still). The format is right, embed the VS code editor directly, no need for the extra hand-holding from the natural games.</p>\n<p>I wonder if it would be better to provide some guidance on which mathlib theorems to use or finding the right ones is part of the challenge ( I used heavily claude, lean explore and apply?). A basic addition can be some way to save the editor state (in local storage or in the url directly). </p>\n<p>One can imagine growing this style of exercises to something like the online programming challenges sites - <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata\">https://www.codewars.com/kata</a>, <a href=\"https://leetcode.com\">https://leetcode.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.codeabbey.com/\">https://www.codeabbey.com/</a> etc, but for short undergrad math proofs.</p>",
