I've been doing some research on automated theorem proving in Lean, during which I encountered a problem: I want my machine learning model to store all the lemmas in the library and to have an ability to insert their names into generated code. <br>\nThe problem is that, in Lean, lemmas are members of namespaces which, in turn, can also be members of other nested namespaces. With that in mind, I have 2 questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the easiest way to universally identify a lemma to insert into code? Is storing lemma names with all nested namespaces (e.g. linear_algebra.matrix.addition_commutative instead of simply addition_commutative which can be ambiguous) a good idea?</li>\n<li>Is there a simple way to extract this full name from Lean code?</li>\n</ol>",
