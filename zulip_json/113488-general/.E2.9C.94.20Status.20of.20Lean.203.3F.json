For example, there's now <code>by</code> instead of <code>begin ... end</code>, plural keywords like <code>variables</code> no longer work (now you just use <code>variable</code>), tactic combinators like <code>&lt;;&gt;</code> now have different syntax, there's way more keywords now, and many more changes.</p>\n<p>An additional complication is that now Lean 4's syntax can be dynamically extended and can be arbitrarily complicated. Most keywords in the language are defined or could have been defined with Lean metacode. This means that having perfect syntax highlighting is effectively impossible, but I think that targeting the most commonly used core syntax is probably good enough for most use cases.</p>",
