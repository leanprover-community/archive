As far as I know, there are 3 ways to use lean on this tablet:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://live.lean-lang.org/\">Lean 4 Web</a> Extremely easy to use, but unstable, unable to do version controlling.</li>\n<li>Cloud-based solution, like Github Workspace. Seems to be easy to use, but need to install the lean toolchain (I never tried it).</li>\n<li>Local installation.  It seems that Lean (elan, lake, ...) is not directly available for Termux environment , and I have to install it in the Ubuntu environment by proot. However, the performance of proot container is really bad. Lean is very laggy. It seems that there is a native Linux Terminal in Android 15 by Google, but unfortunately, my Xiaomi pad does not have that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, what's your opinion? I believe this will also benifit others.</p>",
