For a problem like 1+1=?, it seems that it could be reduced to a proof problem, proving that 1+1=2. However, what about cases where the answer is not predictable? I'm curious if Lean can perform forward computations, like simplifying an expression to start with and then finding the answer during the computation process.</p>\n<p>Is it like developing a proof for a statement with an incomplete assignment to a metavariable x, and then, when the tactic state shows only '2=x', assigning 2 to x?</p>",
