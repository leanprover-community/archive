I am truly grateful for the invaluable support and opportunities that MSR has provided me over the years, allowing me to focus on my passion for exploring theorem provers and automated reasoning, and work on Lean full-time. It is rare to find a job that enables such a sustained and deep focus on a single area of research, and I feel fortunate to have had the chance to do so.</p>\n<p>I am thrilled to share that I will join the Automated Reasoning Group at AWS tomorrow. This is an exciting new chapter in my career, and I look forward to working with both old and new friends and colleagues. I will continue leading the Lean project from there. It will take me a few months to settle on my new position, but I am excited about the future and expect to find new applications for Lean there.</p>",
