Prolog is a programming language, and it is a turing machine. Litex is NOT a programming language, it is a read-only turing machine. There is no control flow, variable, execution in Litex. ANYTHING Litex does for you is 'match and substituion'. Think of Litex as a very fancy “Find or Search (ctrl+f on windows,  cmd+f on mac)\", that is how litex verifies a statement!</p>",

Last week you asked about the difference of Litex(<a href=\"https://github.com/litexlang/golitex\">https://github.com/litexlang/golitex</a>) and Prolog.  Here are similarities and difference between those 2 languages:</p>\n<p>Similarities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Both of them uses match and substitute to derive new facts from existing facts. They both can express existence and universal quantification.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Differences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Unknown facts are by default false in Prolog, while in Litex, they are by default unknown. This is a very important difference. Since what can not say a claim must be false even if nobody can prove it for the time being, we can not say a claim that is not known to be true must be false.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Litex is not a programming language. Prolog is a programming language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prolog does not have a type system, making it hard to express set theory, which is the foundation of mathematics. This makes translation from natural language to Prolog unimaginably hard. Litex by design has a set system that is very easy to use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compared to Litex, Prolog is still too complicated and foreign to most people, partly because it is a programming language. The biggest strength of Litex is that its extremely deep insight into the nature of math and its extremely simple design to make the language as natural as possible. Just like you can use Python or Assembly to write a program and in most cases, Python is easier to use, Litex is easier to use than Prolog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technical difference: 1. exist proposition must be given a name in Litex and it is user's duty to specify which object satisfy the proposition requirement. 2. prolog might encounter dead lock when proving iff condition, and Litex avoids infinite search by setting the upper bound of searching to 2 layers. 3. In Litex, you can express forall facts without giving it a name, while Prolog forces you to do so.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thank you for your feedback.

In the multivariate example I do mentioned existance of tactic can save you a lot of time. The reason why I post it there is that I want to show routine operations like \"by association, by commutativity\" is builtin in Litex. Litex will provide similar functionailities to tactics in the future. I put the example there because that is an example that a child might also understand, and I want more people to have a better idea of Litex (or formal language in general) .</p>\n<p>Again, than you for your comment.

Sometimes we underestimate the difficulty of math itself when formalizing. A small piece of math could mean a long and tedious formalization. sometimes you might find a bug in your original proof this way. While lean solves this problem by providing tactics, Litex solves this by enabling the user to formalize \"the gaps\" as quickly as possible by its simple syntax and more importantly, abstraction is very well handled in Litex. there is no hierarchy in Litex, just as there is no such thing in math. Litex semantics of handling relationships between objects is more like interface in Go, and I am still working on it. </p>\n<p>Again thanks for your kind comment.</p>",

The \"problem\" is that Lean 4 is an extremely broad and wide system, in which you can do regular programming tasks, theorem proving, programming mixed with theorem proving, FFI, meta programming etc. And each use case is a world in itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>THank you Arthur. You are absolutely true. Lean is very nice and broad language. Since Lean is Turing complete and Litex is not, what litex can do all can be done in Lean. Litex is a small domain language, only designed for \"rule-based reasoning checking\". This enables Litex to have tailored syntax for and only for math verification, instead of having to work on language features unrelated to verification. I notice that not all features (like variable or control flow) in a turing complate language is required in math verification. (maybe i am wrong, but my observation is that 99% of the time we do not need that. and if one day i realize they are necessary, i will introduce them to litex as language plugin)</p>\n<p>Again, thank you for your kind comment.</p>",
