Currently, it is <code>0</code>, but I wonder if using <code>log |x|</code> would not be better, as it would satisfy the formulas <code>log(xy) = log x + log y</code> for all nonzero <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and <code>log' = 1/x</code> away from <code>0</code>. Given that proving that something is nonzero is often easier than checking its positivity, this would make these statements easier to apply. Any thoughts?</p>",
