        "content": "<p>Some of you may be familiar with the <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean/\">Glimpse of Lean repository</a>. It tries to provide a resource for people who want to give 2 to 3 hours long tutorials for mathematicians (as opposed to  week-long LftCM). It has been used in many places.  But it never really delivered the initial goal of fitting in three hours while still containing actual proofs (even at first year undergrad level). Part of this failure comes from trying to install Lean or use GitPod or CodeSpaces eating up half an hour. But part of it came from spending too much time on boring stuff. </p>\n<p>On Friday I will try again giving a two hours long tutorial (in Strasbourg). I tried to write a reboot of Glimpse of Lean that really rushes towards proving stuff about limits of sequences of real numbers. I will try to use in lean4web, on the FRO server, and I’m grateful to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"385895\">@Jon Eugster</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"470149\">@Joachim Breitner</span> for help with this technology and the server. I want to use only two files: the old introduction file with no exercise and one file with exercises. It’s probably still too long, because it requires a lot of tactics. I’d be interested in any input if someone has the patience to try to follow this (both beginners and advanced users feedback could be very useful). </p>\n<p>The instructions are in the project <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean/blob/master/README.md\">README</a>,  but it really boils down to two links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FIntroduction.lean\">the introduction file</a></li>\n<li>the <a href=\"https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FExercises%2FShorter.lean\">explanations and exercises file</a></li>\n</ul>",

The fact that we can explain how to use Lean productively without having to resort to multiple lectures on the CIC is a big win. By all means, dive into type theory if the interest is in explaining <em>why</em> Lean does things the way it does. But knowing <em>that</em> it works this way is more than enough for my daily Lean use, and I studied type theory! Not throwing others in the deep end right at the start is a well-thought throug strategy that Patrick, Kevin, Alex (and indeed myself!) have worked hard on, and the work quite clearly pays off.</p>",
