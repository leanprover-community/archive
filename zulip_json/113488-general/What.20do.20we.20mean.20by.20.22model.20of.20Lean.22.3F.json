        "content": "<p>I'm sure you've read Mario's paper on the type theory of Lean. But for a general and simplified explanation, a type theory can always cast in a form that only involves functions and equations, just like how the axioms of groups involves multiplication (functions) and associativity (equations). This is a special case of first order theories, so the definition of models applies.</p>\n<p>But of course much stronger things are true: for example we can take direct products of type theory models just like how we can take direct products of groups, exactly because only equations are involved.</p>\n<p>Another caveat is we usually express these using multi-sorted theories. For example in the definition of a module (in commutative algebra), we have two sets R and M, and the scalar multiplication is a map <code>R * M -&gt; M</code>. The model theory for first order multi-sorted theories is essentially the same as the usual model theory you learn, but you just need multiple sets for the interpretation of variables, etc.</p>\n<p>For an extremely simple example, a model for a dependent type theory would contain a set <code>Ctx</code> that models the possible contexts, and a set <code>Typ</code> for types. There is an operation <code>ctx : Typ -&gt; Ctx</code> that assigns a type to the context it belongs in. So <code>isOdd n : Prop</code> is sent to the context <code>n : Nat</code>. Then there is a set <code>Term</code> and an operation <code>ty : Term -&gt; Typ</code>. So a typing judgement <code>x : X</code> is expressed as <code>ty(x) = X</code> and can be interpreted in the model.</p>",

        "content": "<p>It is a similar notion, but not quite the same. The kind of 'structure' you mention, with interpretations for functions and relations, is the data of a model of a <em>first-order</em> theory. ZFC and certain theories of arithmetic are all first-order theories. On the other hand, Lean is not a first-order theory but rather a <em>type theory</em>. The definition of model is correspondingly different, though in many ways analogous.</p>",
