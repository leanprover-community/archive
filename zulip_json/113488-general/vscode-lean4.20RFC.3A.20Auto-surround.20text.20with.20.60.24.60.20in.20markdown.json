Specifically, when text is selected and the user presses <code>$</code>, the editor should wrap the selection in <code>$...$</code>, rather than replacing it with a single dollar sign.</p>\n<p>If this sounds useful to you, please let me know! I’d like to open GitHub issue for this and would appreciate support or feedback before doing so.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
