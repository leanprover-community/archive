However, at the moment the workflow is still more manual: 1. Users need to fork the repository on GitHub themselves 2. Import the project from GitHub into the system 3. Sync with GitHub 4. Open PRs manually on GitHub</p>\n<p>So there is still a lot of room for improvement. Contributing to mathlib typically requires <strong>running CI, benchmarks, linters, and other checks, and review</strong>, and we are still quite far from making mathlib contributions fully smooth and end-to-end inside the system.</p>\n<p>This entire workflow is on our roadmap. Our team includes several mathlib contributors, and in their spare time they can help review and iterate on improvements to better support this use case. If we can integrated all pipeline including the PR review comments, I think it might be nice</p>",
