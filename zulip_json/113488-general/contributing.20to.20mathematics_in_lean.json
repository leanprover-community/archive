I can recreate the contribution for the source repo of course, but is there a strong reason to not maintain a single repository? I'd suspect a single repo would make it easier for community members to make contributions. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110865\">@Jeremy Avigad</span></p>",
