A linter seems like a good diea, but creating good heuristic is hard. Things like <code>lib</code> and <code>examples</code> are easy to mark, <code>render</code> less so.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that these names would also make the package difficult to require as downstreams users can only require one package with  each distinct name.</p>",
