It's been a decade since we embarked on this path, a journey both long and challenging. The progress we've made was beyond my wildest dreams.</p>\n<p>This year, in particular, has been remarkable. Words barely do justice to my gratitude for all that has transpired. We've witnessed many \"impossible\" feats, including porting Mathlib to Lean 4, a monumental achievement, alongside the release of Lean 4, and launching the Lean FRO. For the first time in a decade, we have a dedicated team of full-time developers enhancing Lean. Their exceptional work fills me with appreciation.</p>\n<p>We're now seeing Lean used in industrial projects. We are thrilled about the burgeoning AI developments built on top of Lean. These advancements fill me with optimism for the dramatic impact they promise in the future. Moreover, the surge of new courses based on Lean 4 is exhilarating. I wish I could personally express my gratitude to each author and share the countless moments of awe and praise their materials have received.</p>\n<p>I also want to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who has developed new tools and packages for Lean 4. Your contributions are invaluable and have played a pivotal role in enhancing our platform. Equally, my heartfelt thanks go to our incredible community members who have tirelessly assisted new users, answered questions, and crafted ingenious workarounds to navigate current limitations. Your dedication and collaborative spirit are the lifeblood of our success. Additionally, I'm profoundly thankful for those who have helped in promoting Lean, organizing events, and staying active on social media. Your efforts in raising awareness and fostering our community's growth are immensely appreciated. Every bit of this work is vital and deeply valued.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I tend to brace for the worst, but looking back at this year, my heart swells with optimism and hope for what the next decade holds. Thank you, everyone, for being part of this extraordinary journey. Your dedication, innovation, and hard work are the pillars of our success.</p>\n<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>",
