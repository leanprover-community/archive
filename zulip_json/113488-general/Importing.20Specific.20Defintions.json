I have been teaching undergraduates to do exactly this kind of thing for 4 years now. Trust me, just import everything and type in the proof you want to formalize, it works fine. You will not be accidentally proving anything difficult, quite the opposite; at the beginning of your Lean journey you will be banging your head against the wall failing to prove obvious things and no tactic will work.</p>",
