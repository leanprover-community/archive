        "content": "<p>I am trying to understand where the Lean community are in terms of defining and proving the simplicity of finite simple groups and what can be done. Below is the picture I have now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alternating groups:</strong> These have been in mathlib since quite early on I think. <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"130609\">Antoine Chambert-Loir</span> has formalised their simplicity and been gradually adding the proof to mathlib.</li>\n<li><strong>Groups of Lie type:</strong> It seems the classical groups (linear/symplectic/unitary/orthogonal) have been defined in mathlib, without proof of simplicity. I couldn't find any exceptional groups. Ad hoc informal proofs of simplicity are sketched in Rob Wilson's book <em>The Finite Simple Groups</em>; the main ingredient is Iwasawa's criterion, which Antoine has formalised. A more systematic approach involves BN-pairs, and I remember seeing some progress being announced in this area. Affine algebraic groups would become relevant here, so I'm also curious about the progress on those (e.g. how much of Malle and Testerman's Linear Algebraic Groups is in Lean?).</li>\n<li><strong>Sporadic groups:</strong> I'm not sure if any of the 26 sporadic groups has been defined in Lean. A lot of results that depend on the CFSG involve checking the 26 groups one by one, so a useful statement of CFSG should probably explicitly give these 26 groups.<ul>\n<li>The biggest obstacle is of course the Monster group. There is a Python library called mmgroup which has been used in a recent paper classifying all maximal subgroups of the Monster group, so I suppose construction is possible in a reasonable amount of time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And regarding the classification (CFSG). The final volumes of the second-generation proof in the project initiated by Gorenstein, Lyons and Solomon are near completion now, and the whole series is apparently at around 5000 pages. Formalising this might be too ambitious to contemplate at the moment, but I would be interested to hear any thoughts about it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think that defining the sporadic groups should be easy, as short presentations are known for all of them or you can just define them as subgroups of symmetric groups by giving generators. Of course proving anything about these definitions will be much harder. As for porting the proof of the classification to lean, I think this should become a standard challenge for AI. In stark contrast to FLT which needs a lot of machinery, the arguments here are far more low level and it would not surprise me if AI could make a decent job of this soon. I think it would be hopeless trying to get humans to do it because the proof is so long.</p>",
