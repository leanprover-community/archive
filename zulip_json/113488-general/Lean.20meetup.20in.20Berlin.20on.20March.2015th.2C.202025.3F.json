There will be a good number of functional programmers in town for <a href=\"https://bobkonf.de/2025/en/\">BOBKonf 2025</a>, which takes place on the 14th. (Lean was the topic of a <a href=\"https://bobkonf.de/2024/breitner.html\">tutorial</a> earlier this year, led by Joachim Breitner and David Christiansen.) If there's enough interest I can try booking a little coworking spot for us.</p>",
