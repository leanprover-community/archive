While type theoretic models can be very advanced topos-like models, when you add the axiom of choice they look more like models some sort of set theory.  Specifically (I think) Mario’s thesis shows that if you built types the obvious way out of sets in a model of ZFC plus infinitely many large cardinals, then you get a model of Lean.</p>\n<p>For example, this shows that you can’t say prove the continuum hypothesis in Lean because we know there is a model of Lean where both the continuum hypothesis holds and one where it doesn’t (by just starting with a model of ZFC plus infinitely many large cardinals where CH does and one where it does not hold).</p>\n<p>So there is not really a need to make a big deal of if the math is the same unless you are worried about say the existence of universes—which ZFC can’t prove but Lean can (and ZFC plus large cardinals also can).

Even for FOL there are many kinds of models like Boolean valued models or models where equality is an equivalence relation.  Models for basic type theories are often categories where types are interpreted as objects in the category and functions are arrows.  The model of Lean’s type theory is more or less the category Set in category theory (but with universes and Prop so it is a bit more complicated).   As for models with soundness and completeness I think the following holds: toposes are models for intuitionistic higher order logic, Cartesian closed infinity categories are models for Martin Lof type theory with one universe, (infinity, 1)-toposes are models of homotopy type theory with one universe.  (I could be misremembering.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110032\">@Reid Barton</span> would know better.)  Since intutionistic type theory is computational, there are also computational models.  Basically certain programming languages can be models of Martin Lof type theory.</p>",
