Thus when I needed to release the <code>v4.8.0</code> toolchain, I was trapped, because <code>ProofWidgets</code> <code>master</code> was not even compatible with being used in Mathlib at <code>v4.8.0-rc2</code>.</li>\n<li>In future, if you make major changes to the build setup, can you please cut a new release, and either notify me that we need to do a Mathlib bump (or do it yourself, or find other Mathlib maintainers to do it). I'd really like to avoid the situation that I need a new release to do a Lean version release, but find myself with a <code>master</code> that hasn't actually been tested yet on downstream repos!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can I leave it to you to work out what needs to change so ProofWidgets is compatible with Mathlib again? Currently, it will run <code>npm install</code> in the Mathlib build process, which inevitably fails.</p>",

Once suggestion I do have is that it would be good to have a release test in the CI. For example, something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>lake<span class=\"w\"> </span>clean<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>lake<span class=\"w\"> </span>build<span class=\"w\"> </span>:release<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>lake<span class=\"w\"> </span>build<span class=\"w\"> </span>--no-build\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I have been debugging <code>main</code> and it is not yet clear to me why the build is broken. The main thing I have deduced is that the produced release <code>lake.trace</code> does not match that which is computed locally when using the release.</p>",
