The central construction interprets the monadic multiplication\n\n$$\n\\\\mu : T_S T_S(X) \\\\to T_S(X)\n$$\n\nas an **idempotent projection** $P : V \\\\to V$ such that $P^2 = P$, via a functor\n\n$$\nF : \\\\text{Kleis}(T_S) \\\\to \\\\text{Vect}_{\\mathbb{R}}\n$$\n\nthat maps computations to real vector spaces.\n\n## 🧮 Core Contributions\n\n1. Defines a functor $F$ from the Kleisli category to $\\\\text{Vect}_{\\mathbb{R}}$\n\n2. Constructs a concrete linear map $P$ realizing monadic flattening\n\n3.
