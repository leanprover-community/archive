Additionally, we have formalized several properties of the caratheodory extension of a measure on locales (including strict additivity  and μ-reducibility) <br>\nThe project is still under development and need some cleaning up, but we are planning to upstream our results to mathlib (especially the basics of locale theory).<br>\nYou are welcome to check out our repo on <a href=\"https://github.com/Bergschaf/Localic-Caratheodory-Extensions\">github</a></p>",
