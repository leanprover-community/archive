        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://leino.science/\">Rustan Leino</a> is a famous computer scientist and a long time friend of mine. In a recent trip, he talked with Shankar and Stephan Merz about some challenge problem that could be used to compare proof assistants. Surely, one would need to have many different kinds of problems for a good comparison. Still, Shankar was excited to suggest “if normalization”, so the 3 of them have been discussing versions to solve this in PVS, Isabelle, and Dafny. Today, Rustan asked me if the Lean community would be interested in the challenge :)<br>\nHere is the summary he shared with me:<br>\nThe data structure is an Expression with boolean literals, variables, and if-then-else expressions.<br>\nThe goal is to normalize such expressions into a form where:<br>\na) No nested ifs: That is, the condition part of an if-expression is not itself an if-expression<br>\nb) No constant tests: That is, the condition part of an if-expression is not a constant<br>\nc) No redundant if’s: That is, the then and else branches of an if are not the same<br>\nd) Each variable is evaluated at most once: That is, the free variables of the condition are disjoint from those in the then branch, and also disjoint from those in the else branch.<br>\nOne should show that a normalization function produces an expression satisfying (a,b,c,d), and one should also prove that the normalization function preserves the meaning of the given expression.</p>",
