There are probably a couple of things that went weird in the migration, so don't hesitate to report things here or, even better, open a PR at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/\">the repository</a>. Ideas about improving the website are also welcome (especially if they come as ready to merge pull requests). Also don't hesitate to add things to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/blob/newsite/lean.bib\">the bib file</a>. Things tagged as either \"about-lean\", \"about-mathlib\" or \"formalization\" will appear on the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/papers.html\">papers page</a>. You can also imitate Yury, Scott or SÃ©bastien trying to beat leanprover-community-bot at mathlib commits speed (last graph of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_stats.html\">this page</a>).</p>",
