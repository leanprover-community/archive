But later I learnt that there are also theorems like <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Real/Sqrt.html#Real.sum_mul_le_sqrt_mul_sqrt\">Real.sum_mul_le_sqrt_mul_sqrt</a>. This would've been useful for my usecase. But what I'm really curious about is why <code>Real.sum_mul_le_sqrt_mul_sqrt</code> didn't appear in the moogle result. The doc strings clearly mention Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. I thought moogle took doc strings into consideration.</p>",
