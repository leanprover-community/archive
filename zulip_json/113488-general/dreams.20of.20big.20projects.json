The books on the subject should be formalizable in full, and it should not be too hard to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Those books will prove that the relevant sporadic groups are indeed simple. What I did for the alternating group (not yet in mathlib) is to use the Iwasawa criterion, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MulAction.IwasawaStructure.isSimpleGroup#doc\">docs#MulAction.IwasawaStructure.isSimpleGroup</a>, and this is a major tool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The geometric groups are more interesting: up to elementary modifications, the special linear and symplectic groups are simple over any field. Orthogonal groups are more subtle, the isotropic ones are also simple over any field (with some counterexamples), but not the anistropic ones (the orthogonal group over a real closed field is not simple when there are infinitesimals).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Something related with simplicity is the classification of the maximal subgroups of these simple groups. For symmetric and alternating groups, this is the O'Nan-Scott theorem, with an important addition by Liebeck, Praeger and Saxl; for geometric groups, it's a theorem of Aschbacher. Indeed, knowing than some subgroups is maximal is a key to their simplicity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The obvious candidate in pure algebra is the classification of finite simple groups. I know that very few people here  (probably nobody?)  feel excited about finite group theory, but we cannot avoid discussing this topic from time to time. In geometry and topology, I think the only comparable result is Perelman’s proof of the Poincaré conjecture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does Lean have exotic spheres? How about exotic $R^4$s? The latter may be striking and not so hard given fully combinatorial versions of \"Heegaard Floer theory\" and friends. Closely related is the Milnor conjecture on unknotting number - may not be well known but not hard to explain.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think a proof of MIP*=RE would be awesome. Especially because some people still cast some doubt on it; putting it on firm footing would be great. It's a fairly deep proof. It doesn't have a lot of \"consequences\" for math in the particular sense that it mostly <em>disproved</em> some other nice conjectures, so it's not something that will be used in later proofs. Of course it had consequences for research and the state of math knowledge, but it's not something that will likely be needed for formalizing other theorems.</p>\n<p>As a more tractable problem, I think a proof of Onsager's solution to the 2D Ising model would be a very nice mathematical result + derivation of a phase transition. This is something I vaguely hope to attempt sometime in the future...</p>",
