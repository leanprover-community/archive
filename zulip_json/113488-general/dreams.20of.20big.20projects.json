The books on the subject should be formalizable in full, and it should not be too hard to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Those books will prove that the relevant sporadic groups are indeed simple. What I did for the alternating group (not yet in mathlib) is to use the Iwasawa criterion, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MulAction.IwasawaStructure.isSimpleGroup#doc\">docs#MulAction.IwasawaStructure.isSimpleGroup</a>, and this is a major tool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The geometric groups are more interesting: up to elementary modifications, the special linear and symplectic groups are simple over any field. Orthogonal groups are more subtle, the isotropic ones are also simple over any field (with some counterexamples), but not the anistropic ones (the orthogonal group over a real closed field is not simple when there are infinitesimals).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Something related with simplicity is the classification of the maximal subgroups of these simple groups. For symmetric and alternating groups, this is the O'Nan-Scott theorem, with an important addition by Liebeck, Praeger and Saxl; for geometric groups, it's a theorem of Aschbacher. Indeed, knowing than some subgroups is maximal is a key to their simplicity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Namely, how should mathlib or other libraries of formalized mathematics deal with highly computational proofs?</p>\n<p>Verifying that God's number is 20 reportedly took about <a href=\"https://www.cube20.org/\">35 CPU years</a>. There are other results in recreational mathematics that took a massive amount of computation (e.g., \"checkers is a draw\" and \"Othello is a draw\"), not to mention results in combinatorics with certificates in petabyte territory. In some of these cases, formal verification might be nice. AFAIK the proofs that checkers is a draw and Othello is a draw are not publicly available in any form (in the case of checkers, there used to be a website where you could interact with the perfect player, but last time I checked, the website was no longer working). A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04715\">fairly recent effort</a> to confirm the nonexistence of a projective plane of order 10 uncovered some mistakes in earlier work.</p>\n<p>Two questions naturally arise. The first question is whether a formal proof of these results is even feasible. How much of a performance hit does formalization introduce? The second question is, even if a formal proof is feasible, one doesn't want to run a gigantic computation every time the library is loaded, so how does one manage the situation? Maybe there needs to be a version of \"sorry\" that indicates that a proof is available but won't be run unless you insist, because it will require vast computing resources? And for the person who does insist, should petabytes of storage be set aside for an exported formal proof, or will it be better to implement a low-memory version that takes longer to run?</p>",

However, these axioms are actually not for pointlike fields in gauge theories such as the quantum Yang-Mills theories. Instead, one would have to consider extended objects callled Wilson loops, as in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/3-540-11559-5\">Seiler's book</a>. As one can see, Seiler's axioms in Section 8  (an analogue of the OS axioms for loops) look rather ad hoc, and there isn't a definite version of \"OS axioms for Wilson loops\" as far as I know. See the comments in Section 3.7 of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3991\">Summers' survey</a>.</li>\n<li>Even if we had a fixed axiomatic setting, to \"prove that ... a non-trivial quantum Yang-Mills theory exists\" is not yet a well-defined problem, as long as we don't have a characterization of the quantum YM theory. In practice, people use different specific techniques to obtain partial results. But the problem doesn't refer to such techniques, so it is not, at least formally, stated what constitutes a Yang-Mills theory.</li>\n<li>Because different people use different techniques, how plausible the \"technical conditions\" in the axioms are differs from one to other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, the techniques which are widely considered most plausible are the ones by Balaban, cited in the problem description. I think it is possible just to fix some technical conditions in Seiler's axioms and to state formally that the construction using Balaban's techniques gives objects satisfying Seiler's axioms, and that would be <em>one formalizable statement</em>. But that would be a very long way, and would exclude other approaches.</p>\n<p>Yet, apart from defining the Millennium problem, I think it's very important just to state the OS axioms (also for Wilson loops) and Balaban's approach.</p>\n<p>(I'm not sure about asking someone with a degree in theoretical physics. This is a problem in mathematical physics, and requires a firm mathematical background even to state the traditional OS axioms)</p>",
