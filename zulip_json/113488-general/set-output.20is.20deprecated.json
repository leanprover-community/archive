When these are approved I will forward port to mathlib4.</p>\n<p>The file <code>.github/workflows/add_label_from_comment.yml</code> (and the review version) need to be updated quite a bit it seems, to use the fromJSON feature (<a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2020-04-15-github-actions-new-workflow-features/#new-fromjson-method-in-expressions\">https://github.blog/changelog/2020-04-15-github-actions-new-workflow-features/#new-fromjson-method-in-expressions</a>) instead of the outdated <code>get-json-paths-action</code>. But this will take a couple of minutes to work out the correct incantation, its probably easier if a maintainer does it anyway seeing as they can actually trigger the ready-to-merge and delegated labels with bors r+ (and then bors r- immediately to cancel) so they can actually test more easily than I could.</p>",
