An idea I wanted to explore was some sort of interactive theorem prover game.</p>\n<p>Basically, what inspired me is the application StackRabbit (<a href=\"https://github.com/GregoryCannon/StackRabbit\">https://github.com/GregoryCannon/StackRabbit</a>)</p>\n<p>StackRabbit is an AI that plays the NES version of Tetris for you, and can calculate the most efficent path to get a a high score given a board. A similar application exists for chess (<a href=\"https://stockfishchess.org/\">https://stockfishchess.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>I wonder if you could do something like this for lean. LIke, every step you take in the game, Lean generates a new path to the solution.</p>",

        "content": "<p>My feeling is that exploring proof space would be much harder than the space of possible actions in a board game and it might be much trickier if not impossible to get a reasonable heuristic about how \"close\" a goal is to being completed. Not only because at basically any goal you have the option to go to an unsolvable state using the wrong tactic.</p>\n<p>Isn't this kind of what <code>aesop</code> does? Trying to generate a new path to the goal based on a few legal moves? and <code>reap</code> sounds like it would do the AI-version of this</p>\n<p>I wonder if things are easier if you already have a working solution to start with and a partial proof which deviates from the sample solution.</p>\n<p>At any rate, if you have some ideas which work reasonably well for simpler proofs, I always wanted to use something like that for an \"auto-hint\" at NNG, but I haven't spend much thought on it yet...</p>",
