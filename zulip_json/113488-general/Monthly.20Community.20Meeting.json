I would certainly not be able to sustain an order of magnitude of more work if all I did was shepherding work by others; my productivity may even decrease. People are <em>very</em> different in this regard.<br>\nMy personal experience from previous software projects is also that a lot of people contributing to the same code base and then bailing to leave the maintenance work to others is really bad from a productivity perspective in the long term. And reviewing the code in such detail that you can maintain it as well as the person that originally wrote it is a lot of extra work vs. the person that wrote the code also being fully responsible for it in the future.</p>\n<p>I also suspect that software is considerably more difficult to review than mathlib proofs where you can easily confirm that they state the correct definition or lemma and that the proof is correct. Style checking and such applies to both. Similarly, I consider maintaining a software library with well-defined APIs to be easier than maintaining a monolithic application.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear: I'm only arguing against the case for a general massive increase in productivity here, not PRs in general (which are valuable for other reasons, too).</p>",

It originally was one of the promises of Lean 4 but, as far as I understand, it never became practicable and none of the heavy-lifting Mathlib tactic (ring, linarith, aesop...) is compiled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Good question. You might know that I put a great deal of effort into making such native compilation possible with zero setup. Today we mostly use this feature when creating executables, such as mathlib's <code>cache</code>. The last time I investigated this topic, the simple reason we didn't move forward was that we really didn't spend all that much time in the interpreter all in all (~10% afair). As precompiling a tactic is not free either, especially with the enormous dependency closure some important mathlib tactics have, optimization effort seemed better spent on other components first. It would be good to reevaluate this state after the recent significant optimizations have landed.</p>",
