I believe what you saw in the Paris thread is just that there are no open-to-the-public current meetups scheduled. That presumably shouldn't preclude you from trying to organize one, it just means try to find some other people who want to get together. Posting in the thread again saying so seems likely to be fine to me as long as you don't repeatedly spam asking that if no one answers you.</p>",
