I'd propose to add a solutions.lean file (or multiple ones, one of each chapter) to the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/theorem_proving_in_lean4\">theorem_proving_in_lean4</a> repository, since I'm suspecting this is where people working through the exercises would first search for solutions.</p>\n<p>A second alternative to this could be to provide a disclaimer somewhere in the document that they could ask for solutions in this community chat. However, this could lead to someone having to answer the same question over and over again.</p>\n<p>A third alternative is to put solutions in the document itself, e.g. \"13. Exercise Solutions\". </p>\n<p>If we go for option 1 or 3, I could provide solutions for the first 4 chapters. </p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",
