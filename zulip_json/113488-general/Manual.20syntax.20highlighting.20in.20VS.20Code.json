The the default VS Code light scheme is not very colorful. The book color scheme is much more vibrant. However, I am not sure if the book color scheme is available as a VS Code theme. This could be a good question for Sebastian. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110024\">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>: do you happen to know if there is VS Code theme that parallels the book's  color scheme or what modifications could be to approximate it?</p>",
