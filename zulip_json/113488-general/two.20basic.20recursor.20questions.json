But I can't convince myself that this should be the recursor, which just means that I don't understand the precise algorithm which goes from the definition of the inductive type to the definition of the recursor. Where do I learn more about that? Is it easy to see if you think about things the right way?</p>\n<p>Q2) <code>=</code> is a prop and <code>or</code> is as well. But <code>or</code> only eliminates to Prop, and <code>=</code> seems to eliminate to Sort. What is the difference? This might just be Q1 again.</p>",

So suppose you have a dependent family <code>C : Pi (b : A), eq a b -&gt; Prop</code>, and you want to prove it holds true \"everywhere\", that is, <code>\\all b h, C b h</code>. Since <code>h : eq a b</code>, and there is \"only one\" equality in the inductive family, namely <code>h = (refl : eq a a)</code>, then it suffices to prove <code>C a (refl a)</code>. And that's the recursor: <code>C a (refl a) -&gt; \\all b (h : a = b), C b h</code>. If you ignore the last argument, it says <code>C a -&gt; a = b -&gt; C b</code>.</p>",
