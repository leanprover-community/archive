I'm trying to capture when equality also means that there has been computations between the terms that are said to be equal. Concretely, in Lean, can we distinguish:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Equality between non-value expressions (by non-value expressions I mean expressions that have at least one more reduction)</li>\n<li>Equality between values</li>\n<li>Equality between a value and a non-value?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And are these notions of equality purely internal or do some of these belong to the metatheory of Lean?</p>",
