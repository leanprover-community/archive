While proof verification isn't a primary focus of the workshop, I'm hopeful to have some folks from the formalized mathematics community join us, as I expect (as an armchair observer of what y'all are doing, for now) tools like Lean and mathlib should be integrated throughout the mathematics research ecosystem in the coming years. If you have any questions, I'll watch this thread or email me at <a href=\"mailto:sclontz@southalabama.edu\">sclontz@southalabama.edu</a> - thanks!</p>",
