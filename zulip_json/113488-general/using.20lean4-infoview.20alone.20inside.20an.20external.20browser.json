Could there be a startup demo for how to do this? maybe something like a project starter. I am not familar with react development and the doc says invoking <code>loadRenderInfoview</code> from a react project requires some extra effort. Thanks in advance! <span aria-label=\"blush\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60a\" role=\"img\" title=\"blush\">:blush:</span></p>",

So the updating automatically part just amounts to you calling, say, <code>changedCursorLocation</code>, whenever the cursor in your editor has moved.</p>",

I may get it now. So my editor is Intellij Idea and connecting to the Lean lsp server. I am also trying to start a web program with the frontend being the infoview in Chrome. Yeah I will see if setting up some websocket connection possible and forward it to the <code>InfoviewApi</code></p>",
