        "content": "<p>As part of <a href=\"https://github.com/HEPLean/PhysLean\">PhysLean</a>, I am creating curated HTML notes for given topics. For example <a href=\"https://heplean.com/CuratedNotes/HarmonicOscillator\">this one</a> for the quantum harmonic oscillator. </p>\n<p>The main component of these notes are the <code>definition</code>s, <code>lemma</code>s and <code>theorem</code>s, which are created from the doc-string of the corresponding def, lemma or theorem in the Lean code. The definitions, lemmas and theorems actually given are from a curated list which show the overall story behind the formalization.To each one of these is a drop down option which shows the Lean code. </p>\n<p>I am looking for ways to improve the <em>structure</em> of these notes. Ultimately I would like two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Relevant words (e.g. names, tactics etc) should, on hovering your curser over them, give you their doc-string.  Equivalent to what happens in <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/\">The Lean Language Reference</a>.</li>\n<li>The Lean code should be openable and runable  in something like <a href=\"https://live.lean-lang.org\">https://live.lean-lang.org</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How easy would something like 1 be to make? I don't really want to have to change the raw lean code or the way e.g. doc-string have to be written. Ideally I would want a function that takes in a name and an annotated (with html links or hoverables) version of the doc string and declaration string. </p>\n<p>I believe 2 is much harder - and would require either something along <a href=\"#narrow/channel/113488-general/topic/Minimal.20lean.20file.20for.20a.20definition.20or.20theorem\">these</a> lines, or a dedicated server that allows you to import PhysLean into something like <a href=\"https://live.lean-lang.org\">https://live.lean-lang.org</a>, which I don't have the resources for.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any other suggestions of how things could be improved? </p>\n<p>(I'm not here interested in the content of the notes - although if there is something within the content which could be improved there is a way to create an issue for a given e.g. definition etc within the notes)</p>",

But I think paying for a  server is probably the best way to go in the long run.  Not least, because I really want an online version of loogle for PhysLean - I think a server would be needed for that too? So any guidance for this would be greatly appreciated!</p>",
