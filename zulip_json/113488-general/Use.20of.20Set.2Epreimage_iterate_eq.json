I don't understand the rationale behind this tag, and this lemma complicates everything I do ; but maybe I don't have the right approach.</p>\n<p>Basically, the kind of situation which I encounter repeatedly is the following :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I have a subset U with a complicated expression. I want to prove e.g. that it is open.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>after straightforward manipulations, it can be written as <code>f^[n]^{-1} V</code> for some  continuous function <code>f</code> and open subset <code>V</code>. Ideally, a single application of <code>simp</code> suffices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>conclude using <code>Continuous.iterate</code> and <code>IsOpen.preimage</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lemma <code>Set.preimage_iterate_eq</code> throws a wrench in this strategy, since it will modify <code>f^[n]^{-1} V</code> to something else. As a result, my current project has too many occurences of <code>simp [-Set.preimage_iterate_eq]</code>. Maybe I could add a new lemma if it were only about continuity, but this is not the only situation where I encounter this difficulty. How can I resolve this obstacle ?</p>",
