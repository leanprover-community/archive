Maybe you will find this interesting if you are interested in Software Foundations :)</p>\n<p>Many thanks to the Lean community here for helping me out when I got stuck <span aria-label=\"pray\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"pray\">:pray:</span> (you'll find some Zulip links in the codebase as references :D)</p>\n<p>PS: This is my first experience in doing non-trivial proofs in Lean, so code reviews are welcome!</p>",

(Don't hesitate to tell me if you think something is missing!)</p>",
