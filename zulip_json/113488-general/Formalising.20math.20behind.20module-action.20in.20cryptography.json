(Not sure how much cryptography I should mention here but I can elaborate if needed.)</p>\n<p>Mathematically speaking, he constructs a symmetric monoidal action of [a bunch of quantifiers here] R-modules acting on [a bunch of quantifiers here] abelian varieties (and group schemes too), see Theorem 4.9. But to do that, he first develops this theory with category of abelian varieties replaced by an R-oriented abelian category (Section 3.4 and 3.5). From the perspective of Lean, this would be perfect, since (afaik) this is just (non-)commutative algebra and category theory now.</p>\n<p>For a concrete example, see the proof of Theorem 3.7. It's purely category theory and commutative algebra, so I would imagine it fits Mathlib pretty well. What do people think?</p>",
