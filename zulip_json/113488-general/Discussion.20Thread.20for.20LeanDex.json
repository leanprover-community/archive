I had forked Justin's repo a few days ago and was working on modifications, but here they are!</p>\n<p>A few questions come to mind...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Will one in future be able to select the lean-toolchain version one searches against? (Including older versions?)</li>\n<li>Will the repo <a href=\"https://github.com/project-numina/lean-explore\">lean-explore</a> reflect the deployed version?</li>\n<li>Will there be a, say, Python client?</li>\n<li>Will the repo <a href=\"https://github.com/project-numina/lean-explore\">lean-explore</a> retain the MCP server?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm sure I'll have other questions too.</p>\n<p>PS: I know selecting the  lean toolchain version is a bit annoying to implement, e.g. the code in the extractor has to be modified for each  lean toolchain version and also there's the time (and cost) spent running everything in extractor and scripts dir to create the vector DB's. But lots of AI provers are working off of slightly older versions. So having older versions around would help a lot! (I was running code in the  extractor and scripts dir for v4.15 over the last days.)</p>",
