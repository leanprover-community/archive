I agree that you could rephrase the problem in terms of an existential statement, and that the resulting problem would have an appropriate form for Duper. I suspect Duper wouldn't solve this problem in particular, but I could imagine Duper solving a simpler version of it.</p>\n<p>More fundamentally, Duper's proofs are inherently classical, so even if you prove the existential statement, you wouldn't be able to extract a program out of the result (as you would theoretically be able to if the proof were constructive). So Duper just isn't really the right tool for program synthesis.</p>",
