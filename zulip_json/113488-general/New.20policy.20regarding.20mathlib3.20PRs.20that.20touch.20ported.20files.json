        "content": "<p>We are still struggling with having too many files in the state \"already ported to mathlib4, but changes have since been made in mathlib3, which have not yet been forward ported\". The number of these has been trending downwards, but only slowly. Too often files in this state are preventing us from moving forward with porting new files (including files on the critical path).</p>\n<p>After some discussion amongst the mathlib maintainers, we have consensus for a throttling mechanism to control this issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync</a> shows the current list of files in this state. (That is, it tracks our \"forward-porting debt\". </p>\n<p>PRs to mathlib3 that modify already ported files are still welcome, but with the following two provisos:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They must be labelled as <code>modified-synchronized-file</code>. (Anyone may add this if they see it is missing, please!)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintainers will not be merging such PRs unless one the following holds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they are directly useful for the mathlib4 port (in which case they will be expedited!)</li>\n<li>the author has no previously merged PRs which still appear on <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync\">#outofsync</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync\">#outofsync</a> has at most 20 items on it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For context, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync\">#outofsync</a> currently has 55 items, although this could be reduced quite a bit by reviewing and merging existing forward porting PRs. We may crank the limit down from 20 to 10 later.</p>\n<p>This change is not intended to blame the authors of PRs to mathlib3 --- they are making useful contributions, and very often the PRs that end up causing problems are ones that have been around for a long time, predating the period where we knew about this issue. However too often forward porting debt is blocking forward progress on the port, and reviewing and managing the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync\">#outofsync</a> queue is absorbing too much time, and this new approach will hopefully remediate this. We simply need a better process to avoid these blockages.</p>\n<p>Apologies to authors for whom this is going to cause delays getting their mathlib3 PRs in. We hope that you'll adapt okay! :-) It would be lovely if authors who are affected by this would redirect some of their efforts into either dealing with the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync\">#outofsync</a> queue (whether their own PRs or others), or just doing direct porting work.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"2494\">@maintainers</span>, if you see mathlib3 PRs that are in this state, please add the label <code>blocked-by-out-of-sync-queue</code>, and for now at least it is probably helpful to post a link to this comment for explanation. Once the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-port-status/out-of-sync\">#outofsync</a> queue drops below the thresholds again, we can go back to looking at these PRs.</p>",
