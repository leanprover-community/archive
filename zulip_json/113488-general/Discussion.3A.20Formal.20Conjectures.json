Of course of course of course, the human must carefully check the result for accuracy.  It seems to me that the big improvement over older or even current chatbots is that Claude Code will proactively exec lean to check for errors, attempt to fix the errors, rinse and repeat.  It will also synthesize and exec lean snippets to figure out how to use a particular mathlib definition, concoct commandline greps to find relevant code, etc.  Outside of mathematics, for ordinary programming, I've had success with Claude Code, especially conducting it to perform small, incremental changes to a codebase, which is how I would conduct myself as a software engineer anyway (since time to debug a new error compounds with the number of features in the change, roughly).  Keeping it on a short leash.  Applying this same approach to Claude Code working on a lean codebase seems promising so far, although I'm only formalizing statements at the moment, not constructing proofs.</p>",
