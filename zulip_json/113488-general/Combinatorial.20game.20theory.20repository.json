However, I'm not actually sure if using that as the definition is the way to go when formalizing results, at the end literature is using the definition via outcomes so I feel like that should be the \"canonical\" one and if this one proves being more useful then have an iff proof that they're equivalent. I guess the real test will trying to use it to prove <code>(g =m AnyGame 0 ↔ g = 0)</code>. I've followed Siegel's paper proof quite closely and the reasoning about outcomes and responses to Left/Right moves translated to lean proof verbatim </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"459227\">Violeta Hernández</span> <a href=\"#narrow/channel/113488-general/topic/Combinatorial.20game.20theory.20repository/near/530875157\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would like to point out something important: <code>IGame</code> cannot represent scoring play, since all outcomes are only distinguished via extensionality</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I'm aware. That also applies to extended forms (ones with tombstones) that aren't useful on their own but they're used for a couple of proofs that we don't have proofs without using them (yet, some folks are interested in that)</p>",
