I'm interested in using Lean as a language for ordinary software development, including software that interacts with the graphics, audio, etc. functionality that SDL3 provides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.everydayimshuflin.com/greg/lean-sdl3\">https://code.everydayimshuflin.com/greg/lean-sdl3</a> is my fork of the lean-sdl3 bindings, to which I've added <a href=\"https://code.everydayimshuflin.com/greg/lean-sdl3/src/branch/master/WebcamApp.lean\">https://code.everydayimshuflin.com/greg/lean-sdl3/src/branch/master/WebcamApp.lean</a> , which performs the fairly-simple task of opening the webcam (if one exists) and displaying it in a window. This mostly involved adding a few more SDL C FFI bindings to the ones that were already present (as well as fixing a few bugs in the existing bindings), namely the functions for interacting with the webcam, and working with displaying a texture obtained from the webcam in a window. If anyone wants to play with this this locally, <code>lake build webcam-app</code>, and let me know if there's any local state on your system that makes this not build.</p>\n<p>I'm already getting sick of manually writing C bindings for lean and I now want to write something like Rust's bindgen (or adapt something that already exists perhaps?).</p>",
