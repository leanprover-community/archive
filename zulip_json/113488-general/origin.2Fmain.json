In order to prevent that happening to other people, could we perhaps just rename the <code>main</code> branch, for example to <code>\nlaughinggas/main</code> or something. Would that be ok with you,  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"250372\">@Ashvni Narayanan</span> ?<br>\nIf we want to prevent that in the future, probably someone with admin rights can set up a branch protection rule so that is becomes impossible to make a <code>main</code> branch, perhaps also in the mathlib4 repo.</p>",
