In this case, however, looks like <code>impossibleInstance</code> only needs to see the current declaration, so we can turn it into a different kind of linter (\"syntax linter\") that is able to run as you type. That would take some amount of work though.</p>\n<p>For now, if you don't want to write <code>#lint</code> on the bottom of your files, you can also run the command <code>lake exe runLinter</code>. In GitHub CI, the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean-action\"><code>lean-action</code></a> can automatically call the command for you.</p>",
