I've chosen <a href=\"https://shiki.style/\">shiki</a> because it can reuse themes and language syntaxes from VSCode. I want to reuse my favorite theme from VSCode (Railscasts Renewed), and most highlighting js libraries don't support highlighting Lean 4, e.g. <a href=\"https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language-contribution.html\">highlight.js</a>, <a href=\"https://prismjs.com/extending.html#language-definitions\">prism.js</a>, <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/examples/lang-package/\">code mirror</a> (these are links to add a new language to them). </p>\n<p>So I would like to share my (quite simple) solution in case anyone needs it too, besides <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/LaTeX.20Syntax.20rendering\">the syntax highligting solution for LaTeX based on minted</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pygments/pygments/pull/2618\">pygments</a>.</p>\n<p>The script is <a href=\"https://github.com/utensil/forest/blob/main/assets/shiki.js\">here</a>, it could be simplified if one only wishes to use <a href=\"https://shiki.style/themes\">bundled themes</a>, or one deploys the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/blob/master/vscode-lean4/syntaxes/lean4.json\">VSCode Lean syntax json</a> like it's bundled. There's also a bit of light/dark theme switch code that needs adaption for the switch mechanism in use.</p>\n<p>To use the sciprt, add the following to your html:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">script</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">type</span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"module\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">src</span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"shiki.js\"</span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"n\">script</span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It looks like this in dark theme (<a href=\"https://utensil.github.io/forest/uts-0003.xml\">test page</a>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/vydtWQyjHg2HtIeureiRjaex/image.png\">image.png</a></p>",

I'm happy to accept PRs to the TextMate Lean 4 syntax highlighting as long as it's not excessively tricky to make the adjustment; the regexes in the grammar shouldn't get too messy and there shouldn't be lots of additional edge cases introduced by a change. Searching Mathlib with the regexes that you are trying to implement can be helpful in this regard.</p>",
