(I would offer to help organize myself, but I'll be trying to get a MathCorps - <a href=\"https://mathcorps.org/\">https://mathcorps.org/</a> - branch up and running in New Brunswick then, so I'm out...). If anyone is interested, feel free to reach out to Brendan directly. I think proposals are due rather soon, maybe mid-Sept. Good luck! Best, Alex</p>",
