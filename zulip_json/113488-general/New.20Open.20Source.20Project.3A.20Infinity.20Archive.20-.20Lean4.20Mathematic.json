I just released an open source project that I hope might be useful for the Lean community.</p>\n<p><strong>Infinity Archive</strong> is a browser-based mathematical IDE for Lean4. I'm still learning Lean myself (coming from a pure math background) and built this with AI assistance as both a learning project and hopefully something useful for others getting started with Lean.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"www\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f310\" role=\"img\" title=\"www\">:www:</span> <strong>Live Demo</strong>: <a href=\"https://inftychi.vercel.app\">https://inftychi.vercel.app</a><br>\n<span aria-label=\"books\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f4da\" role=\"img\" title=\"books\">:books:</span> <strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/Xinze-Li-Bryan/inftychi\">https://github.com/Xinze-Li-Bryan/inftychi</a></p>\n<p><strong>What works now:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser-based Lean4 environment (no local setup needed, though you need to create an account)</li>\n<li>Multi-file project support </li>\n<li>Integration with Mathlib theorems (searchable)</li>\n<li>Real-time verification (though can be slow on complex proofs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Current limitations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Still rough around the edges and needs optimization</li>\n<li>Performance isn't great for large projects yet</li>\n<li>Requires account creation (wallet OR email)</li>\n<li>Built more for learning/experimenting than serious research</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Future hopes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI-assisted proof development</li>\n<li>Better performance and user experience</li>\n<li>Real-time collaboration features</li>\n<li>Maybe a true guest mode for just trying it out</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm hoping that by open-sourcing it and getting feedback from people who actually use Lean, we can gradually make it more useful. Right now it's more like \"lean4web with multi-file support\" but with bigger ambitions.</p>\n<p>Any feedback, suggestions, or contributions would be incredibly helpful as I continue learning both Lean and what the community actually needs!</p>\n<p>Thanks for building such an amazing ecosystem! <span aria-label=\"folded hands\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"folded hands\">:folded_hands:</span></p>",

There's no email registration at all - I misspoke.</p>\n<p>The actual design uses MetaMask wallet's public key directly for user identification (on Sepolia testnet, no real money involved). I thought this would be simpler than traditional email/password signup, but you're right that it's not \"zero-friction\" for people who don't have MetaMask.</p>\n<p>Definitely need to add a proper guest mode for just trying the IDE.
