Awesome, fixing it at the mobile layout seems to work, thanks!<br>\n(I still wonder if it's possible to let it move the infoview around without restarting everything)</p>\n<p>I program on a laptop and so like to have the window I'm programming in be fullscreen. I then keep another window that I want to be referencing behind it taking up the right half of the screen. I'll make the window I'm programming in take up the left half of the screen whenever I want to reference the window behind it. Hopefully that makes sense</p>",
