I rarely had to recompile the entire proof during the process. Regardless, I can agree that that style is better. It's been a while, but I believe the main reason I didn't split it up much is because of the monstrous amount of hypotheses every small lemma would need (and I was never able to get the \"variable\" thing to work properly for me; perhaps I should've tried harder).</p>",
