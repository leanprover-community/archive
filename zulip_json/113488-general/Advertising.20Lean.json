I think that one of the possibly several minimum prerequisites for getting 15 year olds to do geometry in lean is to get the infoview displaying lines and triangles and circles etc, and some clickable interface. The toy example I have in mind is a visually comprehensible proof that angle at centre equals twice angle at circumference via the usual argument with isosceles triangles</p>",

Dependently typed languages are harder than Haskell, but Lean may be easier in some respects than Idris or Agda, because of tactics.

Getting it working seems to me to be a nontrivial endeavour (and I wouldn't have a clue how to start with the visualisation stuff), but as I say the motivation is that I can see it working with 15 year olds. In the UK system 15 year olds are shown proofs of the \"7 circle theorems\" and \"x triangle theorems\" for some value of x, and if we could do those in Lean and then also flag up the issues between angles and directed angles I think it could be turned into something interesting.</p>",

I don't remember ever seeing this and am currently trying to work out what this file does. I've cloned proofwidgets4 and I've opened the file; there's a \"place your cursor here\" on line 189 which displays a line with 3 points on it, and if I move around the proof it keeps printing the same line. There's also a \"place your cursor below\" on line 316 where I see two points (but have no idea what to do next and not really any idea about what to read to find out). Maybe the idea is that I read the code and try proving the theorem and see what the diagram does?
