We also have <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/76a3b82dc0ae6c9a60a8714d74c6cf2b854cf17b/src/computability/encoding.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/76a3b82dc0ae6c9a60a8714d74c6cf2b854cf17b/src/computability/encoding.lean</a> which defines <code>encode_nat</code> which is literally equal to <code>nat.bits</code>. Do we want to unify these into one function? I'm finding it relatively difficult to work with <code>nat.bits</code>, because there don't seem to be a lot of lemmas about it, but it seems wasteful to have two functions doing the exact same thing.</p>",
