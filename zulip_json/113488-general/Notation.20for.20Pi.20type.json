What was the point of that notation? To me, it seems quite odd from a type-theoretic point of view, since the definition 'Pi type' is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type\">well documented</a> and people landing on <code>mathlib</code> with no knowledge of its jargon but knowledgeable about (dependent) type theory would know what <code>Π x : α, β x</code> represents. I might be wrong, but the disappearance of the <code>Π</code> symbol does not look very intelligible to me. At least in the infoview, I would prefer the <code>Π</code> to survive, is it unreasonable?</p>",
