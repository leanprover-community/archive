Loogle and Moogle are already there, and the Lean Community page that's linked has a link to the API docs, but the API page has its own benefits.  For example, you can browse the libraries, menu-style, on the left.  (I wanted to know what sorts of map data structures were available in standard libraries.  Searching on possible function names was less useful than clicking on libraries to see whether they had a Data module, and then checking inside it.)</li>\n</ul>",
