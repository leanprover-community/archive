The spec is that <code>symmetry</code> should change a goal of <code>x = y</code> to <code>y = x</code>, a goal of <code>x \\ne y</code> to <code>y \\ne x</code> and a goal of <code>P \\iff Q</code> to <code>Q iff P</code>, and <code>symmetry at h</code> should do the same for hypothesis <code>h</code>.</p>\n<p>I feel like I could do this one myself in a totally bone-headed way if I knew which book to read (which one goes through examples like this?), not least because it's just <code>apply eq.symm at h</code> etc for me in NNG. But in Lean 3 I think that there was some symmetry tag which you could give to a binary relation once you'd proved a <code>symm</code> lemma for it, and really <code>symmetry</code> should work on all of these. Does this tag still exist?</p>",
