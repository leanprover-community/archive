This is still very new and limited. I am pretty sure there must be bugs and UX annoyances lurking around. I would be grateful to know what you look like and don't like and what changes you would like to see. There are definitely some rough edges and the UX can definitely be improved. </p>\n<p>The extension is called loogle-lean and <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ShreyasSrinivas.loogle-lean\">is available on the marketplace</a></p>",
