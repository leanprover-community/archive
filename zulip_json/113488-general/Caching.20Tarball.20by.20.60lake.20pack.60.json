Previously, whole <code>.lake</code> caching costs 2GB each time, and currently tarball caching, it costs 200MB, it times 10 times smaller size and effectively afford to cache on GitHub Cache by 10GB limitation.</p>\n<p>Now no problem seems to be here in FFL/Foundation. How about this idea? Seems same problem holds on projects using lean-action, like cslib, (see current <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/cslib/actions/caches\">cslib's GH cache page</a>) I opened PR for lean-action (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean-action/pull/152\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean-action/pull/152</a>).</p>",
