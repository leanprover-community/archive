First, a logical term is naturally represented by an inductive type,<br>\nwhereas such terms are notoriously awkward to encode in object-oriented languages. Second,<br>\ntraversing a term can be implemented generically as a higher-order combinator, and so much boilerplate control-flow code can be avoided. Third, backtracking search is dramatically simplified by<br>\nthe use of persistent datastructures, since branches can be paused and resumed at will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe I understand the part starting with \"First.\" However, I do not understand the parts beginning with \"Second\" and \"Third.\" Since no references are provided, I assume these are commonly known facts.</p>\n<p>What is this passage trying to say? What should I read to better understand it?</p>",
