Currently I've started working my way through \"Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning\" by John Harrison and formalizing parts from it. One eventual goal is to have a proof assistant for classical logic with a core checker formalized in Lean, which <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> has helped me achieve a great deal of progress on. But I just meant the channel as a place to organize questions about classical logic in general and, or formalizing it in Lean. It might not get a lot of use, I don't know, no problem if nobody wants it.</p>",
