You're right about needing VSCode changes, but unfortunately injecting a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag inside of React, inside of a VSCode extension will really be a nightmare.

There are two problems; how to specify which libraries you want (eg give some cdn addresses for D3, Katex etc), the second problem is figuring out how to get the lean widgets system to talk to it, because eg D3 relies on the developer being able to write some script, but atm widgets can only make some static html with simple event handlers.</p>\n<p>Adding <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code> with scripts won't work atm but I don't think it's as hacky as it sounds. The lean code is already trusted, eg it can meddle with the file system etc so having it be able to insert arbitrary scripts doesn't seem that bad. The problem is that <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code> takes a JS object as an argument rather than a string, so some C++ would need to change. Even then, the script might be removed from the DOM when a rerender takes place which might be bad.</p>\n<p>One idea: in lean you can write some html or javascript as a string and then you can pass it to vscode to insert statically before any widgets start rendering. There would still be a bit of work to get something like D3 working but you could then do it in principle.
