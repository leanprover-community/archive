You type your query, it shows results as you type, and once you are happy you press Enter or so (maybe ↓ first a few times if it’s not the first hit) and the name is inserted into the document (or copied to the clipboard for convenient insertion). Especially a keyboard-only flow could be quite efficient and pleasant here!</p>\n<p>I don’t think I’m the right person to do VS Code extensions (or extend existing extensions), so this is a call for help: Anyone here keen on implementing this feature? Happy to assist, advise and (I guess mostly) cheer!</p>\n<p>Initially it might be easiest to use the JSON-API on <a href=\"http://loogle.lean-lang.org\">loogle.lean-lang.org</a> directly, eventually though it should use the <code>#find</code> command and cache that comes with your local mathlib installation (once that’s the case); maybe some of the code from the loogle CLI tool needs to move to mathlib (or std? or a mathlib dependency?). But that can follow later.</p>",
