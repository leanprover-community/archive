The problem is that when following the instructions on <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean3/install/windows.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean3/install/windows.html</a>, none of the students were able to create a new project. Is it possible that Lean 3 is not supported anymore? Students always get the same error message: “Server has stopped with error code 1”.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your help<br>\nMattia</p>",
