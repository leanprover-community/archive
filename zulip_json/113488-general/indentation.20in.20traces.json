I assume the idea is \"it's a triangle, so when you click on it you get two new spaces\". Usually I find myself in the situation where I just want to see all the entries because it's never more than a few hundred in my experience, and I think that seeing them all would be less confusing than seeing the indentation. Can I either turn off extra indentation or set some setting so that I see more than 50 trace outputs in a row?</p>",
