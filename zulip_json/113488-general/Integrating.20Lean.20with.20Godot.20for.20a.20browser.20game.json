Based on search results, it seems like I have to compile Lean to WebAssembly (WASM) so it can run in the browser and interact with the game.</p>\n<p>Are there resources that can help me get started with this task? Something like a tutorial would be very helpful because I am new to this, being only familiar with Godot and JavaScript, but not working between different languages in the same application.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>",
