When reading a proof on paper, there is uncertainty about what exactly is going on and the meaning of symbols. In principle, the benefit of computer proofs is that this ambiguity goes away. I've been trying to understand the proofs in mathlib. For instance, the proof that sqrt(2) is irrational, and the proof that the reals are uncountable. I have VSCode setup with lean, and see the goal outputs and types when I put my cursor at places in these proofs. I'm finding that I'm still largely guessing at what each line is doing. In the end it seems no different than reading a proof on paper. I'm wondering if Lean provides any additional debugger tools that let me step through every single step the type checker goes through?</p>",
