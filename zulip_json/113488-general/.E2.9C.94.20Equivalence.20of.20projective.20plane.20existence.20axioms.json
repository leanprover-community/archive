I'll refer to those axioms as <code>exists_config</code> and <code>exists_config_alt</code>. I've finished the forward direction, that <code>exists_config</code> implies <code>exists_config_alt</code>, but am confused about the correct way to proceed for the reverse. Should I not have <code>import combinatorics.configuration</code> for that, since that assumes <code>exists_config</code>?</p>",
