But to get a conversation going: I would like to autogenerate a new project <code>ZeroToRealInSixThousandLines</code> starting from Std and Mathlib, that contains everything needed for the construction of the real numbers, and nothing else. And the resulting project shouldn't depend on anything (except core, of course).</p>",
