In general, we have some randomly defined F : R^3 -&gt; R^3 and want to justify a solution (x0, y0, z0) such that F(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0). Any fixpoint of G(x, y, z) = alpha*F(x, y, z) + (x, y, z) with any nonzero real alpha will give us a solution of F(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0). So if we are lucky enough that there is some alpha such that G is a contraction map (near (x0, y0, z0)), then Banach fixed-point theorem could work. But it's possible that such alpha won't exist, and I need to do this for multiple F's.</p>",
