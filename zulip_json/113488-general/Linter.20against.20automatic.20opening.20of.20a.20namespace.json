It is what I describe in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/6855\">lean#6855</a> but as a linter instead of a language feature. The way I imagine the linter to work is that the program would try to change the first letter of the declaration name (or, for example, it could prepend 'A' no matter if the name starts with 'A' already) and check that the entire declaration still compiles (including the proof if there is one) after changing the name (but not save the changed name in the file).</p>\n<p>How hard do you think it would be to write such a linter? Can you estimate, for example, how much money I should offer to a person implementing the linter? It would come out of my pocket, not from any research budget. I have no experience with linters, so I'd like to ask here first.</p>",
