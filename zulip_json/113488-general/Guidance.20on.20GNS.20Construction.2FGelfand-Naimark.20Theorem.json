You can see my work at  <a href=\"https://github.com/gw90/ThesisProjectRepo\">gw90/ThesisProjectRepo</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<p>I believe I have finished formalizing the GNS construction, so the natural next step would be to use it to formalize the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, but it seems that a good portion of the underlying theory I would need to do that is not yet formalized.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I need the definition of states on a C*-algebra, and a proof that a linear functional f is a state iff it's op norm = 1 = f (1_A). (Alternatively this could suffice as a definition). But, more importantly, I need the existence of a state f_a such that</p>\n<p><span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>a</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∥</mi><mi>a</mi><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∥</mi><mi>A</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">|f_a(a)|=\\|a\\|_A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10764em;\">f</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.1076em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">a</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∥</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">∥</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3283em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">A</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>for all self adjoint a in A (the C*-algebra). The proof of this might not be too bad when all is said and done, but I would like to try to avoid using the continuous functional calculus in Lean just because the api looks intimidating, but if someone who is more familiar with it advises me that it may be easier to use than I expect, I will reconsider.</p>\n<p>I would also need to be able to construct a Hilbert space as a direct sum of Hilbert spaces, which I believe is also not particularly easily accomplished in Lean. (If I am incorrect about this, I would be very happy to be corrected.)</p>\n<p>Alternatively, it might be possible to side-step some work if I can assume A is separable so that I can show it is *-isomorphic to a subalgebra of the bounded operators on l^2 for which I think there is already some theory in mathlib, but I haven't really looked into what that proof would entail, and I'm reluctant to sacrifice any more of the already fairly limited generality of my proof.</p>\n<p>I only have about one semester (150 hours total) to complete this project, or more accurately, half a semester, because at least half will be spent on writing, so it may be a better use of my time to try to get my code mathlib-ready and just aim to merge the GNS construction alone into mathlib.</p>\n<p>So, can anybody with more knowledge of C*-algebras and Lean advise me as to what path may be most fruitful for me to pursue, or most useful to others, in the limited time I have?</p>",

If you can explain how to deal with them, then I might be able to make it work, but otherwise I think it would make more sense to stick with the textbook approach where you mod out by a subspace instead of trying to use this separation quotient, which seems a lot more difficult to work with. Also it's possible I just don't understand what you're suggesting and so I'm implementing it incorrectly, because I'm not very familiar with topology, but if you have an example or reference I can work from, then I might be able to figure it out</p>",
