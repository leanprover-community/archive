It all depends on what you're doing. One practical reason to avoid <code>finish</code> is that if you use it in the middle of a lean 3 proof then you might find that later stages of the proof become tedious to write because Lean keeps running <code>finish</code> so you have to wait 5 seconds before you can see the output of what you just typed. <code>tauto</code> can be much quicker though. It's easy to check that there are many many occurrences of <code>tauto</code> in mathlib3, so it's acceptable there -- but, again, if you're just doing an independent project then you can do what you want!</p>",
