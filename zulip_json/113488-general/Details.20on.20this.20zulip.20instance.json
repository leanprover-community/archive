I have some questions if you have time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this instance hosted on the free plan or the $6.67/user/month plan? Or is it self-hosted?</li>\n<li>How do you deal with transient users who post a couple times then never again? The zulip website says you can deactivate them manually, is there a way to automate that to reduce costs?</li>\n<li>Do you use any backup method to duplicate the chats for posterity?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are looking at switching to a zulip/mailing list community setup, similar to Isabelle. Any other feedback or accounts of experiences with this would also be appreciated!</p>",
