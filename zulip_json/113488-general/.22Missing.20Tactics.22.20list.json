I mean this in a fairly narrow sense, so  it could be either specific abstract algorithms and decision procedures, or specific tactics present in other proof assistants, that could  reasonably be adapted to lean. <br>\nAs a practical example, I'm thinking about things like Buchberger's algorithm (I remember a discussion about implementing it in lean) or the <code>omega</code> tactic (though that one is now available). </p>\n<p>So if there is anyone who would have really benefited if procedure X had been implemented, say Wu's algorithm for IMO-grand challenge people (?), they are welcome to chip in with their wishlist.</p>",

Do we want an aesop rule that scans for <code>∃ a', ... ∧ a' = a ∧ ...</code>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Would it also be possible to fill in the data part for a structure? e.g. If I have something like <code>∃ S : Subfield ℝ, S.carrier = {x ∈ ℝ | ∃ u v : ℚ, x = u + v * √3}</code>, would there be some way to fill in the data for the strucuture and leaving the properties as goals? (like a nested refine + rfl would do?)</p>",

All unused arguments in <code>B</code> will move to the right of all used <br>\n  arguments, without reordering the unused arguments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now rewrite with <code>t</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
