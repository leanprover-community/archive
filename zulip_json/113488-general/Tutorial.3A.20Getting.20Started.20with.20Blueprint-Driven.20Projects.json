It aimed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the design, management, and implementation of blueprint-driven formalisation projects in Lean, with almost no prerequisite knowledge of Git, GitHub, continuous integration systems, and other technical tools.</p>\n<p>You can watch the video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KyuyTsLgkMY\">here</a>. All relevant references are available in the video description.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"KyuyTsLgkMY\" href=\"https://youtu.be/KyuyTsLgkMY\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/9f2465947ec8dfc4bfae294b11a158f31d5f8cbb/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f4b79757954734c676b4d592f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><p>I hope you find the content clear and informative. I encourage you to test the <a href=\"https://github.com/pitmonticone/LeanProject\">template</a> and the new <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint\">LeanBlueprint</a>  and share your feedback. Your critical comments and suggestions are highly appreciated: they will be invaluable for improving these tools and for future formalisation projects in Lean that depend on them.</p>",

I think that spaces in labels names are a rather evil feature of LaTeX that is half supported by the ecosystem (independently of leanblueprint). So I would not recommend using them. But you may have collaborators who are addicted to them. Globally LaTeX is a very permissive language, and this creates a huge gray zone of semi-allowed things, much like with HTML. This creates a tension when working on leanblueprint. Spending a lot of time and code obfuscation in order to support LaTeX corner cases is not fun, and can seem very counter-productive. But habits are hard to change, especially for people who start using Lean after spending decades using LaTeX. And, more importantly, Lean blueprints can start their life as ordinary LaTeX files meant for ordinary publication. In that case spending a lot of time tweaking the LaTeX source to make it acceptable for the blueprint is also not fun and a waste of time.</p>",
