Also, I'm delighted to see someone using the Lie theory. My immediate remarks are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>please consider upstreaming as much as possible to Mathlib</li>\n<li>please consider joining in on the (semi)simple version: <a href=\"https://github.com/ocfnash/LieClassification/\">https://github.com/ocfnash/LieClassification/</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nice work!</p>",

I've also posted about it here: <a class=\"message-link\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/116395-maths/topic/Low-dimensional.20Lie.20algebras/near/520791067\">#maths &gt; Low-dimensional Lie algebras @ 💬</a> <br>\n(because I don't know what the appropriate channel to discuss it is). As mentioned there, we have already converged on a theorem for our first pull request, and we will (slowly) start preparing it now.</p>\n<p>I'd also be willing to join your project on semisimple Lie algebras at some point! Although I can't yet promise when that will be, because of other obligations.</p>",
