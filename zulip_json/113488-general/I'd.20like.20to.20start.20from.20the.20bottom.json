I was wondering if anyone had advice on the practical logistics of this. </p>\n<p>Is it feasible to not even link mathlib? <br>\nI think trying to write tactics myself would be a bridge too far. Are those in mathlib or built into Lean itself?<br>\nI saw that natural numbers are special cased in the compiler. Is that going to be a problem if I'm trying to write my own nat type?</p>\n<p>If anyone has advice for the minimal reasonable base to start from it would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>",
