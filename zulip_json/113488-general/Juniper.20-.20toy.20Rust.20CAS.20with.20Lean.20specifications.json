I mostly built it to get familiar with Lean types, Lean metaprogramming, and how Egg works, but I think the overall concept is pretty cool, and I'd definitely like to see CAS projects move in a more formal methods direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MixedMatched/juniper\">GitHub repo</a></p>",
