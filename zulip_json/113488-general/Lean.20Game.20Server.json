In the British Natural Number Game you could imagine all the same levels, modified appropriately, and then you can ask where overall the proofs are shorter or longer, and I bet the answer is \"longer for addition, shorter for multiplication, longer for <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>≤</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\leq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7719em;vertical-align:-0.136em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">≤</span></span></span></span>, shorter for divisibility\".
