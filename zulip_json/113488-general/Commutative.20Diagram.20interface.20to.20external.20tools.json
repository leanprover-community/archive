I know this all sounds exciting and extremely difficult, but just then imagine trying to do all that <em>without</em>  Lean4, etc.  Seems to me that the most expressive way of doing this would be to piggyback off of Lean4.  Yes, I am aware of the InfoView CD Widget.   </p>\n<p>Can anyone here write me an interface and I will code the rest?  Reason I ask is because I would have to learn Lean4 from the basics in order to hack this together.  Looking for any guidance as well!  <span aria-label=\"sunglasses\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60e\" role=\"img\" title=\"sunglasses\">:sunglasses:</span></p>",
