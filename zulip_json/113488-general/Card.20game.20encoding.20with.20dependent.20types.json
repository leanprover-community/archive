I have been contracted to write the digital version of a tcg ( think games like yu gi oh and magic the gathering ) </p>\n<p>I have previously look into programming such a game in haskell and got the following resources :<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTJsixtT9aGqH7Va0f98-trfWb1qxB1bLHJdda1jUM0/edit?usp=drive_link\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTJsixtT9aGqH7Va0f98-trfWb1qxB1bLHJdda1jUM0/edit?usp=drive_link</a></p>\n<p>I am wondering if anyone has an idea on implementing such card games that would make use of dependent types as in lean 4. Or whether this is a field where the dependent types subset in haskell ( GADTS among other features ) are enough</p>",
