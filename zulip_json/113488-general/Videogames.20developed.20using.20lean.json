I wanted to ask whether there are any projects that use Lean 4 as a general purpose programming language, for example to develop a video game.</p>\n<p>I have found not much about this topic online. There appear to exist raylib bindings for lean:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/KislyjKisel/Raylib.lean\">https://github.com/KislyjKisel/Raylib.lean</a></p>\n<p>And there is also this <br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dwrensha/lean4-maze\">https://github.com/dwrensha/lean4-maze</a><br>\nbut it hardly constitutes an interactive application.</p>\n<p>Is there any project that better illustrates these capabilities of lean? I'm not looking exclusively for games, just for about anything that's interactive or graphical in some way or another.</p>",
