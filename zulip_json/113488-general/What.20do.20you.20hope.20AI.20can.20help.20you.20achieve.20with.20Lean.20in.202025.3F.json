The closest we have come to this is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06209\">LeanAgent</a> (see the discussion in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"219941\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving/topic/LeanAgent\">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving &gt; LeanAgent</a>).  While I think LeanAgent was a bit oversold, it showed the vast potential of such a feature, even with a mediocre theorem prover.  Just being able to look up a lemma in Mathlib which matches the sorry theorem, or better yet two lemmas which need to be combined non-trivially to complete the sorry proof, could be a huge help. And if one can actually make a good theorem prover which fills in difficult <code>sorry</code>s it could be a massive game changer!  It would probably change the way people write their projects.  They would leave a lot more <code>sorry</code>s in the code in the hope that the AI would complete them.  But the discussion about LeanAgent also highlighted a bunch of other real-world challenges.  What happens if it just proves a sorry using inconsistent stubbed lemmas, or because <code>sorry</code> theorems behave wierd logically (although this is particially fixed in the newest version of Lean)?  While this is probably useful information, it could be a bit noisy to get silly PRs proving theorems with obviously inconsistent lemmas.  Also, one needs a good way to have the agent adapt in real time to the new code base which filled with new definitions and theorems.  (LeanAgent addresses this with continual learning, but there are many other approaches as I outline in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"219941\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving/topic/Keep.20AI.20theorem.20provers.20up-to-date\">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving &gt; Keep AI theorem provers up-to-date</a>.)</p>",

Two problems with the current AI assistants for Lean are that (1) they are hard to install and therefore <strong>almost no one</strong> tries them out, and (2) they aren’t very good.  I think many who have used Isabelle feel very fondly of Isabelle’s <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2009-1/sledgehammer.html\">SledgeHammer</a>.  And I think that is because both it is easy to install (or so I’ve heard) and it is decent at completing easy goals.  I think AI is probably better now than Sledgehammer, but users haven’t seen that in real life.  As for user experience, the most user friendly system would be a VS Code plugin calling out to a (free?/cheap?) API similar to Github Copilot, Continue, Cursor, etc, but with better Lean integration.  (Of course, APIs bring privacy concerns and are not for everyone, but that paradigm is taking off.)  Another system design which also isn’t that bad are tactics which do one of three things: (1) suggest a next step, (2) complete a proof, or (3) suggest lemmas and definitions to use in the proof.  (Lean Copilot has this interface for example, and Lean has a nice “Try this” feature to make it easy to accept the proof or suggestion from a tactic.) They could be hosted locally or use an API.  I think there is still a lot of design room for small, fast locally hosted provers (not necessarily using transformers).</p>",

This works for benchmarks like MiniF2F (and maybe for the <code>sorry</code>-filling agent idea above), but it doesn’t work for in-the-editor Lean integration.

Also Lean Copilot (unlike ReProver) is not RAG based.  It is just an LLM predictor with no RAG.  The important thing for the current Aesop feature is that you have a model to suggest tactics as strings.  I might be possible to use DeepSeek-Prover to suggest a whole proof (if you could run it conditioned on the goal state) and then wrap that proof in something like <code>by</code> to get it to behave as a single tactic.  I don’t think you could do DeepSeek-Prover v1.5 style MCTS where you take a proof, find the errors and start repairing there.
