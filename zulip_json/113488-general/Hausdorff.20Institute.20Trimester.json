The organizers have said that at this point you can be vague about the dates and leave comments with more information about your constraints. You can also use the comments to clarify your interests in coming. (I am live streaming what we are hearing from Josef Urban and Peter Koekpe here at the business meeting of ITP 2023.)</p>",
