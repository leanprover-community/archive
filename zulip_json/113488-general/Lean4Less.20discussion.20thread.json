And in the process, it <em>introduces</em> axioms, like the <code>prfIrrel</code> axiom above (which is definitionally true in Lean). It builds the proof in parallel to normal kernel typechecking, and it doesn't do anything more intelligent, like trying to get around using proof irrelevance when it doesn't have to use it. So it's not applicable to translating proofs to evade the use of certain things like the axiom of choice or the excluded middle property. I do have plans to soon extend it to eliminate other defeqs, like struct and function eta for example (there's just a little bit more I need to parameterize first in order to try that out)</p>",
