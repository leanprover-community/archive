        "content": "<p>Kevin Buzzard, Rob Lewis, Patrick Massot, and I have started working on a new tutorial introduction to Lean and mathlib, with help from Gabriel Ebner. It is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean</a>. The tutorial is meant to supplement other sources, like Kevin's Natural Number game, Patrick's tutorial, and TPIL. There is overlap. The goal is to provide as much useful learning material as possible for people looking to learn how to formalize mathematics and contribute to mathlib.</p>\n<p>There is also an online version: <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/\" title=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/</a>, but we recommend using the VS Code version. We hope to get some new chapters out quickly over the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>In VS Code version, the examples and exercises are opened in an <code>examples</code> folder and you can save your work. Caveat: we don't yet have a good way of updating the tutorial without moving your files and resetting the repository or making a fresh copy. And the infrastructure may get additional bells and whistles. But in the meanwhile, the current version provides some fun exercises for people looking for things to do.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi, I have started this tutorial and I think it's great so far.  I completed the natural numbers game a few days ago, and have no other experience with lean or any theorem proving software.<br>\nI think it would probably be good to say a few words in the first page about the VSCode interface. For instance, how to open the Goals window if you closed it by mistake, and perhaps how to split/switch tabs according to how you expect the user to interact with the tutorials.<br>\nI also found a typo in the first exercise of 2.2 : The theorem to prove says (a+b) + -b = 0.<br>\nMaybe it's good to leave it there though, it teaches readers that theorem provers can be useful to spot mistakes in theorem statements <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span></p>",

I just corrected the exercise in the version I am working on, so it will be fixed next time we put new material online, hopefully within the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>As to adding more information about VS Code, from my experience writing documentation, it is a bad idea to mix purposes. Information then become fragmented, outdated, etc. I think it makes more sense to have a stand-alone markdown document with information about the VS Code interface and FAQs in the mathlib documentation folder (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/docs\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/docs\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/docs</a>). Or maybe such a thing already exists somewhere? I'd be happy to link to it from the text if someone writes it.</p>",
