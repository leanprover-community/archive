Ideally given a repository that has a blueprint folder, I can get the information about all the nodes in the dependency graph.</p>\n<p>If there is, I'd really appreciate some pointers, and if not I'm happy to work on it if someone has a clear idea about how best to achieve this goal. This is part of the goal I'm trying to achieve at Oberwolfach for the \"Autoformalization correctness metric\" project.</p>",
