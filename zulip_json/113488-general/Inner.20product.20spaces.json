The non-trivial K-automorphism of L is denoted c, say (c for complex conjugation if K=real and L=complex) and then one can consider a non-degenerate hermitian sesquilinear form on an L-vector space. For it to be positive definite you need some notion of positive though, so then K should embed into the reals.</p>",
