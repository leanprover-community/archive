My understanding is that this would require the <code>simp</code> and <code>rw</code> syntax/tactics  to have some kind of integration with the lean LSP server, which would allow them to add extra detail to LSP responses when the cursor is within their range of tokens. Does anything like this currently exist?</p>",
