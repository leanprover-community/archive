It's not going to let them pull from the repo (or treat it as a git repo in general), but if all they want is a copy they can play with, just using the \"Download ZIP\" may just unblock things -- i.e. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean/archive/refs/heads/master.zip\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean/archive/refs/heads/master.zip</a></p>\n<p>Otherwise yeah SSH SOCKS proxying is always a decent way around silly networking restrictions.</p>\n<p>For 2) I <em>think</em> there's a chance that if you have the student download GitHub desktop -- <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">https://desktop.github.com/</a> -- and log in through there that may obviate them from needing to learn how to generate SSH keys themselves. I definitely don't recall whether the app will automatically add the SSH key to their GH account (I suspect not :/) but yeah it may at least simplify the process. Again though not sure.</p>",
