However in tricky cases (file splitting for instance) it might not behave as I intended, and in such cases I wish I had not done the merge. It is always possible to cancel it, but the question I wanted to ask is:<br>\nIs there a way to see what the merging will do to the files I modified on my branch before merging?</p>\n<p>I'm using VSCode.</p>",
