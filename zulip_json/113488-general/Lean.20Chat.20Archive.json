For example, I had to manually copy the content when I wanted to share <a href=\"#narrow/stream/208328-IMO-grand-challenge/topic/Current.20status.3F/near/327700013\">this post</a> in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"208328\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/208328-IMO-grand-challenge\">#IMO-grand-challenge</a>.

Wouldn’t it be useful to keep the static file (I assume) archive for, well, archival, linknig and googleability reasons? There is so much knowledge in the history, it might be prudent to keep it around in that form?</p>\n<p>Ah, it seems I found the right topic where this was discussed last.
