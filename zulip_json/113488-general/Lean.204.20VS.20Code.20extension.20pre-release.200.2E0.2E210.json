Notable changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new Lean installation procedure that automatically installs Git and curl on most common systems instead of requiring users to install them manually from the terminal (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/vscode-lean4/pull/641\">vscode-lean4#641</a>)</li>\n<li>Language server support for lakefile.toml (syntax errors, auto-completion and hovers) via <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml\">Even Better TOML</a>, which the Lean VS Code extension will now depend on (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/vscode-lean4/pull/646\">vscode-lean4#646</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9871\">lean4#9871</a>)</li>\n<li>A new sort order of 'All messages' that sorts messages by their proximity to the text cursor, instead of their absolute position in the file (can be changed with a setting) (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/vscode-lean4/pull/645\">vscode-lean4#645</a>)</li>\n<li>A recommended minimum Elan version of 4.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The full changelog can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/releases/tag/v0.0.210-pre\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I'd be very grateful for any help with testing this pre-release before we roll it out to everyone. You can install the pre-release by opening the 'Extensions' side-bar view, clicking the cog icon on the 'Lean 4' extension and selecting 'Switch to Pre-Release Version':<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/cLD-Fq0kY-xM1NPMfgu4PiZB/image.png\">Switching to pre-release</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/cLD-Fq0kY-xM1NPMfgu4PiZB/image.png\" title=\"Switching to pre-release\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"647x354\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/cLD-Fq0kY-xM1NPMfgu4PiZB/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>Thanks!</p>",
