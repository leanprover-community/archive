When it happens, the next lemma, specifically the <code>grind</code> at 204 (probably, because I never cleanly narrowed it down to one line), occasionally gets stuck, and very quickly freezes my entire computer within a few seconds. It is not a total freeze, as I can still move my cursor very slowly (and my background music still plays some sound once a minute), but basically nothing responds till I do a hard reboot. I guessed that this is RAM exhaustion, as I have experienced similar things before when I know I accidentally allocated a lot of memory, but I don't have direct evidence for this. It has happened 4 times within an hour at the same place, so at least this part is consistent.</p>\n<p>Some basic information:<br>\nOS: Ubuntu 24.04.3<br>\nProcessor: Intel i7-11700<br>\nMemory: 16 GB<br>\nLean tool chain: v4.26.0-rc2</p>",
