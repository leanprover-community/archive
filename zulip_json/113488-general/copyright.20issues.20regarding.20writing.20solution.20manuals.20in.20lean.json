If no such solution manual exists, then it is likely, at worst, fair use. Furthermore, if the textbook was NOT written with Lean in mind, Lean solutions would be clearly transformative. Also, if you do not include the original problems, but just the solutions, your work would be very non-derivative. Thus, it should be fine as far as I am aware.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer (yet).</p>",
