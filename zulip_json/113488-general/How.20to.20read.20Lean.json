        "content": "<p>We have plenty of guides on how to write code in Lean, but as far as I know, there are no guides on how to read code in Lean. I don't mean philosophical treatises on the role of computers in research or how to believe machine-checked proofs. I mean a short and straightforward tutorial that we could ship with our Lean projects, allowing people who can't write Lean to understand what we have proved without relying on us to translate our results into informal language (which can go wrong on so many levels).</p>\n<p>Lean has an amazing syntax that can effectively communicate mathematical ideas both to computers and to people. However, no matter how intuitive the syntax is, there are still things that need to be learned before one can understand a theorem statement written in Lean. Most tutorials on Lean focus on the \"tactical language\" (the <code>by</code> DSL) and perhaps assume that the meaning of terms is usually understood using the context and readers' background knowledge. I'm not talking about writing proofs as terms; I mean all the terms in definitions and statements.</p>\n<p>I initially thought that the term language could be easily understood by normal mathematicians who had never been exposed to Lean. I was wrong because I took many things for granted — there are many \"unknown knowns\" in my mind (and probably in your mind, too). For instance, people often don't automatically know that the things in parentheses right after the theorem name are assumptions. They also might not know that they can easily look up the meaning of the <code>⬝ᵥ</code> operator, for example.</p>\n<p>I would like to address these issues in a tutorial on how to read Lean. Do you have any suggestions on how to write it well? I want it to be short and sweet, and not necessarily foolproof.</p>",

I just looked at the whole paragraph. With some word-smithing, I'd write it as follows:<br>\n`<br>\nWe would like to define irrationals numbers to be the set difference ℝ − ℚ. Unfortunately, we cannot quite write it this way in Lean. Lean isn't based on set theory; Lean uses type theory. Therefore, we cannot say that rational numbers are a subset of real numbers: for example, the rational number 5 and the real number 5 are of different types. Instead, rational numbers are embedded in real numbers: each rational number corresponds to a unique real number. In our example, the operator ↑ denotes this embedding. (In fact, it could denote several other embeddings, thus we must add the explicit type annotation ℚ → ℝ).</p>\n<p>We see that x is irrational iff x isn't in the range of the embedding function, i.e, x is a real number that doesn't correspond to any rational number. We check that it agrees with our intuition what \"being irrational\" means and go on.<br>\n`</p>",
