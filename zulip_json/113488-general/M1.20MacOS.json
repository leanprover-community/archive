I followed: <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html</a> which says to install x86 version. But I later discovered <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html\">https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html</a> which says it is also available for M1 arch. How do I uninstall everything done in this first guide? I know how to uninstall elan using brew, but does this also remove the other steps I did with elan?</p>",
