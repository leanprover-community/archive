So instead, I would just write out skeletons beforehand, and then during lecture, spend most of the time \"on the blackboard\" before playing the levels to completion. Then after each lecture, I had AI convert the skeletons to fuller text, while I prepared the following lecture. What I'm doing now is going through the whole game from scratch and reorganizing everything. I think there will be very little AI-generated text (but surely not none) in v1.0...</p>",
