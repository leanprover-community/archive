I'm not super familiar with Lean or type theory, but surely the proof is expanded to eliminate the convenient language features and make it possible the kernel to check. Similar to how machine code is unreadable for humans but it's unambiguous to the CPU. What is the expanded representation for Lean proofs called and where can I read more about it?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
