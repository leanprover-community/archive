Members of the admin team may be re-elected.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Ebner has asked to step down at the end of this year. We are pleased to announce that the remaining admin team members have been elected to serve again in 2024, and that Scott Morrison and Sebastian Ullrich, both members of the <a href=\"https://lean-fro.org/\">Lean FRO</a>, will join the team as well. Welcome Scott and Sebastian!</p>\n<p>A key reason for increasing representation from the FRO is that we would like to explore ways of better serving the broader Lean community. Developing and maintaining Mathlib has been a central part of our activity, but other overlapping communities are active on Zulip as well, including people interested in using Lean as a programming language, people interested in using Lean for verification, and people building AI and machine learning projects on Lean. The community will be even stronger if we find ways to support these groups and integrate their activities. This may include things like expanding the web pages with additional information and appointing new teams to develop and maintain community resources. </p>\n<p>We are looking forward to exploring these possibilities with you and thinking about how the community should evolve to accommodate all the exciting things that are going on.</p>",
