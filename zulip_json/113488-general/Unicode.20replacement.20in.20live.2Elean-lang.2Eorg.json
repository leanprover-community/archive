This is different from the behavior in vscode, and I find it quite disorienting. Is this change intentional? Is there a way to disable it?<br>\nEDIT: this also happens with other characters, e.g. <code>\\aq</code> -&gt; <code>αq</code> with the cursor between <code>α</code> and <code>q</code></p>",
