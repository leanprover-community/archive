I'd love to do something similar with the Lean logo—just a simple mug design with the logo on it.</p>\n<p>Before moving forward, I wanted to ask: is the Lean logo considered open source, or otherwise freely reusable for something like this? If there are any guidelines or restrictions I should follow, I'd be happy to comply.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>—Pedro</p>",
