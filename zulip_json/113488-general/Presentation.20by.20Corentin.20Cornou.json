Everyone interested in this topic is welcome to attend the presentation.</p>\n<p>Title: A step towards the formalization of the finite groups of Lie type</p>\n<p>Abstract: The classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) is one of the most important achievements of 20th century mathematics. It states that every finite simple group either is a cyclic group of prime order, an alternating group of degree at least 5, a finite group of Lie type or one of the 26 sporadic groups.<br>\nThe complexity of the statement of the CFSG makes it a perfect candidate for formalization. Most of the groups of the classification being groups of Lie type, formalizing them marks a first step towards the more<br>\ngeneral formalization of the whole classification.<br>\nThe length and complexity of the definition of a group of Lie type raise difficulties concerning its formalization. However, all the finite groups of Lie type are endowed with a BN-pair structure that can be used to characterize<br>\nthem. The concept of BN-pair (or Tits system) is, in itself, pretty simple and is a formidable tool that can be used to prove nontrivial results or serve as foundation for the formalization of the theory of finite groups of Lie type.<br>\nIn this talk, we will introduce a formalization in the Lean proof assistant of the notion of BN-pairs, as well as some properties of groups possessing such structure. In particular, we present a framework that can be used to<br>\nshow the simplicity of simple groups with a BN-pair, and apply it to the case of the projective special linear group over a field. Additionally, we will use the example of the general linear group to give illustrations of the results throughout<br>\nthe talk.</p>\n<p>Join meeting:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZmFhYjZjMjctMzc2YS00Mjg4LTk2YzYtNzRiZWM3N2RhOGJl%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221b1832e2-2ac0-437c-b4a8-4128da4efb97%22%7d\">https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZmFhYjZjMjctMzc2YS00Mjg4LTk2YzYtNzRiZWM3N2RhOGJl%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221b1832e2-2ac0-437c-b4a8-4128da4efb97%22%7d</a></p>\n<p>Meeting ID: 343 175 558 530<br>\nPasscode: dua9Kn</p>",
