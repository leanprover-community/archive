One of the main problems of using AI to assist with proofs is that they can cheat and intentionally hide difficult-to-discover error inside the proof. Lean is widely advertised as an ideal solution - it is impossible to cheat, proofs are verified down to axioms of math, and are 100% correct. The user only need to check that (i) the Lean formulation corresponds to what you wanted to prove and (ii) that the proof compiles correctly. Now you say that this is not the case: the AI can cheat by adding sorry, admit or stop (ok, this is easy to check).  It also can cheat by adding \"weird meta code, notation, etc\", or by making \"a declaration would silently error and not be added to the environment\". But even after checking all this, it is still no warranty that the proof is valid, because \"there are some more time-taking extra steps you could do\".
