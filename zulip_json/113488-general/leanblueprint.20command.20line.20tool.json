There are a few things to note, like leanblueprint depends on <code>kpsewhich</code> via plastex, which requires a minimal TeX installation. Plastex also needs the <code>bbl</code> file generated during PDF generation for the Bibliography and thus the <code>--keep-intermediates</code> option of Tectonic.</p>\n<p>In general, Tectonic has good compatibility with complicated LaTeX files as it reuse the LaTeX packages, only in an incremental way, but there are some caveats to pay attention to here and there, I can't recall all of them, but at least it doesn't play very well with minted and similar packages that requires executing external commands. That said, Tectonic alone works sufficiently well but it plays less nice with plastex which is the backbone of leanblueprint and assumes the existence of some parts of the LaTeX installation.</p>\n<p>During pfr projects, I was <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/pfr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Autensil\">polishing the CI process</a> using the old fashioned TeXLive way and my own workflow also moved back to the old fashioned TeXLive way as a testbed and also because of a few caveats of Tectonic, for one, I wanted to include the generated GraphViz/dot file (of the dep_graph) in the PDF, but I had some trouble with Tectonic but not TeXLive.</p>",
