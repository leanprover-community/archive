One thing the project has taught me is that Annals is very skewed in the kind of mathematics which it likes to publish, and my impression is that other journals like Inventiones are publishing a rather different distribution of AMS classification numbers.</p>\n<p>Here is a list which I think would get us hundreds of recent Annals papers.</p>\n<p>Abelian variety (in alg geom), Abelian variety (in diff geom), Jacobian (in alg geom), Jacobian (in diff geom).
