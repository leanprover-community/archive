In that they explain that the MEPs explicitly want OSS to be included, because a lot of European businesses are SMEs and asking them to check their entire software stack (90-95% of it being OSS they use) is too expensive</p>",

The exceptions carved out for OSS are very very limited and might probably not cover Lean. Only lawyers can tell, and a lot depends on court precedents.</p>",
