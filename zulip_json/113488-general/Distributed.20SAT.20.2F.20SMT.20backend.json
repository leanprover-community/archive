We would definitely be interested in integrating other solvers with the <code>bv_decide</code> tactic of Lean. Looking at the code base of Mallob you already seem to have support for LRAT? That would be just perfect, <code>bv_decide</code> currently operates on LRAT proofs produced by CaDiCaL so integrating other LRAT producing solvers with it should be pretty easy.</p>",

Oh yes, cool! Sure, Mallob supports LRAT (or more specifically the LRUP subset). Depending on how your LRUP parser and checker is implemented, there might be some bumps with large proofs (clause IDs up to 2^63 bits and large gaps between them, also potentially very large active clause sets), but we could just see how it works out!</p>",

    {
        "content": "<p>The parser and infrastructure can in principle deal with large clause IDs, I'm not quite sure the checker is able to handle gaps but that can be changed. One issue is that in the current setup <code>bv_decide</code> is not able to check a proof step by step but parses everything upfront, then starts to check. This is due to technical constraints in Lean's architecture when generating proofs that the kernel accepts. So if the certificates are too large we might end up running out of RAM. I think this is something that can be engineered as well though.</p>",

Anyways, sounds like a cool project if you're also interested! :)</p>",
