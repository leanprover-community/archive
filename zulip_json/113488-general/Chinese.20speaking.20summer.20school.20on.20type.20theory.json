The summer school will strive to ensure people with different levels of background knowledge can all have something gained. The summer school will be online and recorded.</p>\n<p>You can visit <a href=\"https://m4p1e.github.io/ntype-cafe-summer-school/\">the website</a> for more info. If you would like to learn about a particular topic, or if you'd like to be a speaker yourself, you can submit them at <a href=\"https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DU0NwSGVPdXRFT0pL\">this shared document</a>. You can also participate in the organizing by joining the QQ group 791437680. (QQ is the equivalent of Discord in mainland China.)</p>",
