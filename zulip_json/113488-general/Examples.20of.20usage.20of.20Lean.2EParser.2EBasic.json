Since I knew that Advent of Code problems many times require that you implement a parser (for instance, this year's Day 3), I wanted to look into idiomatic ways of doing so in Lean. That's when I came accross <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Lean/Parser/Basic.html#top\">Lean.Parser.Basic</a>, which seems to do what I want.</p>\n<p>I've found the documentation a bit hard to follow, and was looking for some examples which could hopefully help me understand the contexts of some definitions. However, I didn't come up with anything while searching online. Does anyone have any good examples on how Lean.Parser.Basic is supposed to be used? How do you create a parser, and how do you run it?</p>",
