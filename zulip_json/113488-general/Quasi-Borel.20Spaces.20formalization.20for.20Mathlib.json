For context, Quasi-Borel Spaces (QBS) were introduced by Heunen et al. in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02547\">A Convenient Category for Higher-Order Probability Theory</a> as a semantic foundation for higher-order probabilistic programming. They provide a cartesian closed setting where higher-order functions and continuous distributions fit together and they form the basis for much of the modern work in higher-order probabilistic programming languages.</p>\n<p>Our formalization is still a work in progress, but a substantial portion of the core development is in place, including the basic QBS structure, many standard closure properties, and a strong probability-measure monad. If this feels like something that could eventually belong in mathlib, we’d really appreciate comments on design, structure, naming, or anything that stands out. The repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/YellPika/quasi-borel-spaces\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who takes a look!</p>",
