Ivanov’s <em>Beyond Sperner’s Lemma</em>. </p>\n<p>In this formalization, we discretize the simplex and apply Scarf’s combinatorial dominant-color framework with indexed linear orders to produce colorful points whose images have shrinking diameter, and the resulting convergent subsequence yields a limit z where coordinatewise monotonicity plus unit-sum constraints force f(z) = z.</p>\n<p>I warmly invite you to have a look at my results and would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions.</p>\n<p>URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/math-xmum/Brouwer\">https://github.com/math-xmum/Brouwer</a></p>",
