However, in recent years the NSF DMS has made it clear that they are interested -- see e.g. the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/aiming-artificial-intelligence-formal-methods-mathematical\">AIMing program</a> and the new <a href=\"https://www.mathinstitutes.org/institutes\">NSF institute ICARM</a>. A couple of years ago there was even an explicit call for REUs that incorporated formal methods and formalization.</p>\n<p>In short, I expect the proposal you describe will be new to them, but they will be interested. It may find its way to reviewers who know something about formalization, but it may instead go to analysts. Whatever you do, try to write something that will be interesting and accessible to both audiences. It will help to describe what is currently in the library, what you think should be done next, and how you plan to go about doing it. The proposal should convince reviewers that formalizing the theory of C* algebras is a good thing to do and that you are capable of doing it. It's o.k. to be tentative; you can characterize some components of the proposal as straightforward and others are more ambitious.</p>",
