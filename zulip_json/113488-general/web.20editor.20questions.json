I am currently on mobile and I would love to be able to just click on something which jumps me from code posted in Zulip directly to the same code in the web editor on my phone. On the desktop app there is a link on every code block which might do this (I haven't clicked on one on them in years because when I'm on desktop I just cut and paste into lean locally). Can this be made to work for mobile?</p>\n<p>Will the web editor stay at this German link or will it be adopted by lean-lang? Or will there be rival editors like in the lean 3 days (one mathlib compatible and one not :-/ )?</p>\n<p>Finally, I just tried to run some lean code posted on Zulip, on mobile, by manually copying the entire message into the web editor and I got a \"read only file system\" error with <code>import Mathlib</code>. Is something broken?</p>",
