    {
        "content": "<h2>A few considerations:</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Should it drop Lean 3 support immediately?</strong></p>\n<p>I choose to make them work together for the transition period because converting all <code>\\lean{some_theorems}</code> to <code>\\leanfour{SomeTheorem}</code> or just <code>\\lean{SomeTheorem}</code> could be as easy as replacing them with CamelCase or they could end up somewhere quite different with some different name, it's better to provide a transition period, at least I need it in a scenario that the dependency is changed to Mathlib 4 but the project itself is still in Lean 3 and porting, so it makes sense for the blueprint to accommodate that.</p>\n<p>It's likely the official leanblueprint will drop Lean 3 support without hesitation and use  <code>\\lean{SomeTheorem}</code>, but it's easy to port <code>\\leanfour</code> to <code>\\lean</code> as it's just a simple global replacement without ambiguity. So this solution is future-proof.</p>\n<p>During the transition period, <code>mathlibtools</code> installation has been made optional, as long as you don't use the old <code>\\lean</code> and stick to <code>\\leanfour</code> in your Lean 4 project, you are safe to just use <code>leanblueprint @ git+https://github.com/utensil/leanblueprint.git@lean4</code> (if there's consensus on the approach I will open a PR).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Where should it jump?</strong></p>\n<p>I prefer to jump to the doc, but it can be made jumping to source with an option to replace the trailing <code>#doc</code> to <code>#src</code> as this is supported by docgen4. But I think this is a loss of information, because one can jump to the source from the doc if needed but not vice versa.</p>\n<p>The old  leanblueprint requires running a Lean 3 script to collect the declarations to make a precise jump, this can be done for Lean 4 in principle, but I fail to see the necessity in a minimal setting and I need to figure out how to do it idiomatically in Lean 4. So this part is left out, but the UX is almost not affected, the only difference is that it might not jump to the precise one if there is ambiguity but this can be considered a feature to find similar theorems or definitions.</p>\n<p>EDIT: One requirement difference is that the target project needs to use <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4\">docgen4</a>, because the old one supports jumping to Github source without a docgen setting. But this requirement is towards a better practice.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why <code>\\leanfour</code> instead of <code>\\lean4</code>?</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, LaTeX doesn't directly support digits in macro names. There are workarounds, but they make the solution more fragile. So I stick to <code>\\leanfour</code> and also it's easier to replace it without ambiguity and reasonably simple to type.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this fits my own need for now, and it's easy for anyone else to make one with some different preference by reading the diff <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint/compare/master...utensil:leanblueprint:lean4?expand=1\">here</a>.</p>",

Where should it jump?</strong></p>\n<p>I prefer to jump to the doc, but it can be made jumping to source with an option to replace the trailing <code>#doc</code> to <code>#src</code> as this is supported by docgen4. But I think this is a loss of information, because one can jump to the source from the doc if needed but not vice versa.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The advantage of a src jump is that you can permalink to a specific commit, unlike a doc link that can break.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it means the blueprint must link only to documentation hosted on the same website and generated at the same time.

Currently Alectryon and LeanInk are fundamentally tools handling one Lean file at a time. There is no way you can get links between files. So you don' t have the html analogue of jump to definition, or even preview lemma statement, so it is not really usable. I'm also pretty sure there were more serious bugs, but maybe nobody opened issues because it seemed abandoned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and only few are bugs for edge cases, so overall LeanInk is in good shape and the major issue is to make LeanInk work with something  else to produce the HTML instead of relying on alectryon?

Böving</span>  As it's technically feasible, is it desired for doc-gen4 to generate imported part of Mathlib for a math project (with an addtional flag)?</p>\n<p>IMHO, a math project is better to host the exact version of Mathlib it uses, but only the part it uses instead of the whole Mathlib which might contain totally unrelated math branches. I estimate this should be able to reduce the size/build time to 1/3 or less, as a math project is likely only depend on that much of human math.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right now doc-gen is simply instructed by lake on what modules to build docs for and just does that. It is not intended for a doc-gen task for one module to build documentation for others due to two reasons:<br>\na) races with other lake tasks. Say you give lake two things that rely on some shared files in mathlib and use this discovery mechanism. You end up doing the same documentation computation twice for no reason.<br>\nb) this reduces parallelism drastically (this was the main motivator to use lake instead of orchestrating the build process on its own in this \"dynamically discover what to do fashion\" which was the previous implementation)<br>\nRegarding the parallelism, if you check the mathlib4_docs actions you will see that due to the large amount of cores that we have on these machines generating documentation for mathlib4 + all of its dependencies + core is a thing of just 20 minutes. If we fall back to this discovering mechanism we would in fact end up having worse run time compared to the current mechanism the larger of a mathlib fragment you depend on.</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that the idea of only building the stuff you need is necessarily invalid, but it should not be part of doc-gen itself to decide on what to build in order to keep making use of maximum parallelism.</p>",
