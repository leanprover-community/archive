I ask because there is at least one other theorem prover that has an extensive homology library; HOL Light already had 5700 lines that lead up to the Eilenberg-Steenrod-Milnor axioms and 5000 for consequences and applications in 2018, see PDF linked from <a href=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Using.20the.20LTE.20snake.20lemma/near/291439861\">this post</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/blob/master/Multivariate/homology.ml\">Github repo</a>. Of course I don't think they have abelian categories nor derived functors and so it's not at the right generality if we want \"the full spectrum of (co)homology theories\" (they just formalized one), but can we really claim that \"The first formalizations of the ingredients\" is only recently completed?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anything planned about spectral sequences?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

        "content": "<p>Two responses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The workshop is not exclusive to Lean. Needless to say, we hope/expect that Lean will be very well represented ;) Concerning the wording in the announcement -- this was actually a recent change which seemed appropriate (particularly for our community) given the last few minutes of Kevin's talk from ICERM. If you look at the \"official\" press release on the workshop webpage, you will see the sentence \"The first formalizations of (co)homology have recently been completed, and the time is ripe to add the full spectrum of (co)homology theories to the formal libraries.\" I hope you agree that this is a more accurate representation of the state of affairs. In any case, you bring up a good point, and we will make sure to use the right wording if/when we make this announcement elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Please interpret the word \"cohomology\" however you want :)</li>\n</ol>",
