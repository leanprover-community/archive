I figured I would keep things simple, and just upload the documentation generated by doc-gen4 and the blueprint generated by Patrick Massot's plastex plugin to the github repository, and browse it using github Pages. The issue I have is that doc-gen4 generates some pretty big '.bmp' files, which would require git-lfs. Is there a simple way around this? Should I be doing things differently? Or should I just go ahead and use git-lfs?</p>",
