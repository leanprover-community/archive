A few lessons I learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>De Bruijn factor: I followed the proof <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartz%E2%80%93Zippel_lemma\">here</a>, which is about 550 words, not including equations. The first pass of the proof is around 400 lines and took me 19 hours all told (not including some false starts at the beginning I didn't record). </li>\n<li>What makes or breaks the time mostly seems to be how long I take to find lemmas/whether I find the right lemma first.</li>\n<li>A lot of the friction is actually in VSCode/the extension rather than mathlib itself - autocomplete not loading quickly enough, useless dropdown menus etc.</li>\n<li>A different limiting factor is managing in my head the analogy between the paper proof I am reading, and the version of it I am formalizing, with all the small modifications (sets instead of probabilities, rearranged addition instead of natural subtraction, etc.)</li>\n<li>When it gets down to lemmas about very low-level types like <code>Fin</code>, I expect automation to handle things, but it often doesn't.</li>\n<li>The prospect of people watching me code is not enough to stop me from swearing profusely (sorry if that bothers anyone, I promise I actually love and appreciate you all).</li>\n</ul>",
