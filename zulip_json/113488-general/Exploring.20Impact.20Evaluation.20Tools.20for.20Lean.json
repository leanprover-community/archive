I’m especially curious about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which kinds of evaluation or measurement tools could make collaboration easier or more effective?</li>\n<li>What would help contributors focus on the highest-impact work?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a small proof of concept, I recently experimented with combining the Lean dependency graph with <code>git blame</code> data. I’d be happy to help shape and concretize projects in this direction if there’s interest.<br>\nexperiment here: <a href=\"https://github.com/iammadab/lean-extract\">lean-extract</a></p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!</p>\n<p>Wisdom</p>",

But I think the diff-size approach overstates the impact of library level rewrites or refactors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Bottleneck finder</strong> / <strong>Dynamic difficulty estimator</strong> / <strong>Foundational value scoring</strong> <ul>\n<li>I think there is less along these lines, though I have recently been trying to use LLMs to ask questions about the <a href=\"https://1000-plus.github.io/\">1000+ theorems database</a> to see if I can find theorems that are important in these ways.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing I would personally be interested in seeing might be a list of all theorems that the <a href=\"https://mathlib-changelog.org/v4\">mathlib changelog</a> tells me I added, sorted by number of times those theorems have been used by PRs that weren't mine.</p>",

So the dependency graph will only tell you so much. Looking at the total diff <em>might</em> be better.</li>\n<li>your impression \"this knowledge is implicit in experienced contributors' heads\" seems spot on; certainly most critical gaps in the differential geometry library are in the relevant people's heads, but not written down anywhere.
