However, I can only see the sentence \"This looks fine to me, I've left some comments which are mostly about docstrings.\" that he sent after all the comments, but cannot see the comments. I have tried various methods including: logging out and signing in again, using a different browser, accessing the pull request page using another device. But I still cannot see his comments. How can I solve this problem? The following is a picture of my screen:</p>",
