Being able to bisect effectively without false positive breakages is very valuable. Thus, I think what GitHub is doing here <em>is</em> a proper implementation of the \"Not Rocket Science\" rule. The fact that bors did not do this is actually surprising, as it violates the principle of monotonically increasing test coverage expressed in the article by Graydon (i.e., by an x-axis of commit # in the default branch, test coverage is not necessarily monotonically increasing).</p>",
