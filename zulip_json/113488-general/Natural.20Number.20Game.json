I'm not an expert in type theory, and, in my limited reading, as far as I can tell a \"construction\" is a representation of a term of a type (i.e., a term constructed using lambda abstractions, match statements, pi types, applications, and so on). To prove/calculate things in Lean, you have to construct a proof/algorithm, but as part of the user interface you are able to manipulate partially constructed proofs/algorithms.</p>\n<p>Concretely, Lean expressions are an inductive type (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/expr.lean#L85\">defined here</a>, at least on the Lean side -- Lean is also written in C++). An expression that still has <code>mvar</code> constructors seems like it should correspond to what they mean by a \"partial construction.\" When two expressions are unified, <code>mvar</code> expressions unified with any other expression get replaced by that other expression immediately, there and at all occurrences (at least, it's as if it did this -- the algorithm does something more efficient). Presence of metavariables after a certain point in the typechecking process triggers the \"don't know how to synthesize placeholder\" error message.</p>\n<p>There's some more complexity with metavariables that I'm aware of, but don't fully understand, and those are \"delayed abstractions\": metavariables that are allowed to depend on a list of local variables.</p>",

We went over the fact that if the goal is: <code>a + (b + 0) + (c + 0) = a + b + c</code>, and you <code>rw [add_zero]</code>, it will do the first one it finds. We spent a little time going over the fact that you could alternatively do <code>rw [add_zero c]</code> to rewrite the other instance; then we learned how to use <code>nth_rewrite</code>, <code>repeat</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>But then we got to the \"big boss\" of <code>2 + 2 = 4</code>; and if you do a single <code>rw [two_eq_succ_one]</code>, it applies it to <em>both</em> instances of <code>2</code>! Naturally someone asked why it did that, and I mumbled something to move us along (\"nothing to see here\"). Of course it's not a big deal, but pedagogically, is this what we want? (Or is there something better I could/should have said about the change in behavior?) Thanks!</p>",

In which case, <code>rw [add_zero]</code> simply wouldn't work as it's a function and not either an equality or a bi-conditional.</p>\n<p><code>(add_zero 5)</code> on the other hand is an equality -  specifically <code>(5 + 0) = 5</code>. </p>\n<p>This version of <code>rw</code> replaces all instances of <code>5 + 0</code> with <code>5</code>.</p>\n<p>Lean's actual rw tactic is a bit more powerful than this though. It will accept functions so long as they eventually return an equality and it can find a values for the parameters along the way. It doesn't exhaustively look for these values though,  it'll just go with the first ones it finds.</p>",
