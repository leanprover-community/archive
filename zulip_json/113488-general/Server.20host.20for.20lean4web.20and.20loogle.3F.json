I've experimented a bit with <code>DigitalOcean</code>, and tried to follow the instructions <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4web?tab=readme-ov-file#build-instructions\">here</a> for lean4web, but ran into memory problems on the <code>npm run build</code> step. </p>\n<p>If anyone knows of any detailed steps for setting up these online with a project downstream of mathlib that would also be very helpful!</p>",

It will take 40mins or so to download the mathlib caches.<br>\nIf you want a different hostname you can use CNAMES to point to that. <br>\nNot sure how to adjust the size of these garnix machines. But of course the nixos setup works elsewhere as well, the garnix is just a (maybe too) convenient way of deploying and hosting this stuff.</p>\n<p>If you can it's maybe easier to use a more conventional way of hosting to get started (i.e. get a hetzner machine, install nixos, run <code>.deploy .#live</code>)</p>\n<p>To adjust which repos are hosted you’d have to fork <a href=\"https://github.com/kha/lean4web\">https://github.com/kha/lean4web</a>, but in principle the relevant information could be in this repository as well.</p>\n<p>For those willing to try out garnix to host something like this, maybe join the discussion at <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/960235377506025542/960235378030301216/1346929006007554079\">https://discord.com/channels/960235377506025542/960235378030301216/1346929006007554079</a></p>",
