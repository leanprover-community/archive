You can sign the form or contact members of the team directly if there is something you want to discuss. There are links to all of these on the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/meet.html\">community information page</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110026\">@Simon Hudon</span>, who originally founded the code of conduct team, has just stepped down, and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"130384\">@Riccardo Brasca</span> has graciously agreed to take his place. Thank you Simon, and welcome Riccardo!</p>\n<p>It speaks well for this community that the code of conduct team does not generally have much to do. On social media, it's all too easy for people to be put off by a perceived act of aggression, a thoughtless remark, or a bad joke. When that happens here, someone generally speaks up and things get resolved constructively. We have adopted the convention of using a <a href=\"#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Community.20Guidelines/near/235207529\">#butterfly</a> emoji as a way of tagging remarks that might cause offense, providing a gentle reminder that we have to be especially careful on social media to avoid hurt feelings or misunderstandings.</p>\n<p>Thank you, everyone, for making this Zulip channel such a friendly, supportive, and pleasant place to be.</p>",
