This discipline should be about developing ideas based on rigorous foundations and logic, which is a useful and important purpose. Once you have understood those ideas, even \"advanced\" results often seem quite simple and intuitive, and we can take that understanding and apply it to other work if helps us to make useful progress. However, the amount of needlessly obscure terminology, poor notation and just plain bad writing in formal papers make the whole field absurdly inaccessible, even to many who might have no trouble understanding the underlying concepts and important results.</p>\n<p>Just imagine what would happen if we tried to write engineering specs or software the way postgraduate mathematics research is done. We'd be trying to debug source code where every identifier was a single character, taken from one of three or four different alphabets, with several of them looking similar enough to mistake one for another, with a bunch of combining accent modifiers on top that were used to fundamentally change the semantics of the program, interspersed with comments by someone who needs a remedial class in basic writing skills, full of technical terminology that is defined in terms of other technical terminology from other software packages, except that sometimes the meaning is subtly different in this context but that isn't noted anywhere on the screen at the time, resulting in needing to spend half an hour doing a depth-first-search of all the definitions only to find that a function whose only identifier is the name of the developer who wrote the second version (because the first person to work on it already has another function bearing their name) is actually equivalent to what a programmer would write as</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>const DAYS_IN_WEEK := 7\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I write this as someone who studied mathematics to a high level and has touched on the field many times since in connection with heavily mathematical software development.

The learning curve for any computer algebra system is quite steep and all of the other systems relied on \"learn by trial\".</p>\n<p>Now look at Lean. Take, for example, group.lean. It is a wall of text. Finding a theorem relies on odd names like mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul. The whole of the \"communication\" with people, such as it is, is contained in that name. Programmers made the mistake of this \"pile of sane\" (POS) approach, witness the \"src\", \"inc\", \"tst\", and (usually empty) \"doc\" directories with \"semantic naming\" like parser.c, <a href=\"http://SMTFuns.pl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://SMTFuns.pl\">SMTFuns.pl</a>, or <a href=\"http://catsim.ml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://catsim.ml\">catsim.ml</a>.</p>\n<p>Suppose, instead, there was a group theory textbook in latex. The textbook explains the ideas in natural language. It contains all of the lemmas in group.lean, each  one with a paragraph or so of explanation. The lemmas are in named \"chunks\", basically a verbatim block with a name. Lemmas should only be accepted when they contain a paragraph or section in the group theory volume.</p>\n<p>Now you have a book, with a table of contents, a table of equations, chapters, sections, paragraphs, an index, and a bibliography, all hyperlinked and searchable. Since each lemma is in a named verbatim chunk you can extract any or all lemmas automatically, letting the compiler do it. You can find relevant lemmas by looking in the table of contents or the index.</p>\n<p>Code to extract a named chunk is 170 lines of C. Axiom already uses this technology.</p>\n<p>The idea is called \"literate programming\" (Knuth). You write for people, and incidently, write for the machine.

For lean this would likely be coq, where a lot of work (tactics especially) in lean have learned from prior work done in coq, rather than reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<p>2) which of these would be the easiest for mathematicians with some programming experience to learn to use to create machine-verifiable proofs?<br>\nLean of course ;). More seriously that's  a very difficult question to answer as the answer depends on personal preference, how much experience the user has with different types of programming languages. </p>\n<p>3) which of these have a good translator that turns a machine-readable proof into something a human reader might gain insight from?<br>\nNone of them? ISABELLE/NAPROCHE  and forthel are projects that go in that direction, but is more aimed at writing a human readable proof that a machine can read, rather than translation. Peter Koepke and Tom Hales have thought about how this might work in lean but I'm not aware of any publications (yet).</p>",

He told me that bold was the notation in the books originally when notation began to be standardised, and then blackboard bold was invented for blackboards, so the correct notation when working in a non-blackboard format (e.g. print)  is bold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a very strong opinion on this subject. It is one of the few places where I dare to disagree with Lenstra (and Serre!).</p>\n<p>Typography is the art of making things invisible. If you notice the design of some piece of text, it is distracting you from the content. If something stands out, it better be important. For that reason we <em>emphasize</em> the word that is being defined in a certain definition. For that reason, it is okay to print the word <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> in bold when you state it (but not when you refer to it, probably).<br>\nIn my thesis I went so far as to not have <em>any</em> bold text anywhere. But I think that judicious use of bold text is fine. If a user is searching for a theorem statement, then it can help if the eye is attracted to <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, the eye need not be attracted to the symbol <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68611em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">N</span></span></span></span></span>. Of course it is a very important notion in mathematics. But probably not for the topic/page that I'm writing right now. I therefore think that the blackboard bold letters (<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{Q}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.88333em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span></span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Q</span></span></span></span></span>, etc) strike an excellent balance: they are elegant and unintrusive.</p>",

(There is a \"structured view\" button in the top right of any metamath web page, but note that these files are hosted on an external website so sometimes the pages are missing.) Some of the plans I discuss in the thread have the possibility to improve rendering by associating notation to constructs in a tree-structured way, something that metamath.exe has historically not been able to do, limiting it to sequences of GIF images that you usually see (I think unicode is the new default though).</p>\n<p>The other reason you might find metamath web pages unreadable is the high density of symbols due to the presentation style that puts every step on a separate line. I'm sure if you presented lean proofs like this it would also be quite dense (generally single lean steps take up a whole page for the context, so the full thing would be huge). I can imagine a variety of tool assisted ways to make this more focused. Perhaps we can do something like the lean tactic view, where you see one step at a time and can scroll around; I'm not sure how effective this would be.</p>",

The difference is that <code>size</code> is <code>int</code>-valued rather than <code>nat</code>-valued, and the reason for this choice is because subtracting sizes from eachother and other <code>int</code>-valued expressions happens all the time, and I never want to worry about <code>nat</code> subtraction. The alternative would involve a bunch of fussy bookkeeping before each invocation of <code>linarith</code>. </p>\n<p>And <code>size</code> gets used from the very beginning to do everything. I'm very comfortable with this decision for my project, but I don't imagine it would suit mathlib very well to have a separate API simply for the coercion of <code>finset.card</code> or <code>fincard</code> to <code>int</code>.

I really tried to apologise for my actions in my INRIA talk last year. It is not my intent to create enemies of any kind. I am not horrible, I am just quite autistic and occasionally say or do stupid things without thinking about the consequences of my actions. I do not bear a grudge against anyone who said anything about me in the Coq community. I think that what is happening now in Lean now with the Scholze challenge speaks far louder than \"man in stupid trousers says all maths is wrong\" or \"ignorant non-CS person says Lean is better than Coq\". I am much better able to express myself now and my views are far more refined and educated.</p>",

I thought that he wanted to be sure of his theorem with Clausen, and was probably also a bit curious of the efforts needed for such a task, but it comes to me as a surprise to read that in Scholze's mind <em>digitization must be done with caution</em>. I wonder whether Harris has directly asked Scholze about this (as an aside: I am not sure that the quotation from Dick advocates for this caution neither, but this is another point).</p>",

I sometimes worry that everything we love about mathematics -- the clever ways that the right conceptualizations extend our cognitive reach -- are just crutches that we humans have developed to cope with the fact that we can't fit everything in our heads at once, and that we'll eventually give up and leave it to the cloud and machine learning will do everything we need.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I find that as machine learning has improved, it seems popular to just toss it a problem and hope it magically figures out a solution without the user ever having to understand the solution themselves. In fields where this works, it tends to decrease interest in research to fully conceptualize or formalize the problem as the machine can just produce the desired results.</p>\n<p>When it comes to ATPs, though, I would think this would be a bit less of a concern. One can at least inspect the generated proof to figure out the way the machine got from point A to point B. Most other applications of machine learning don't have that luxury.</p>",

It feels like he's criticizing ITP by criticizing a strawman of the ITP community - there are certainly ITP folks with a hard formalist position, ones who think that formalized proofs should replace peer-reviewed formal proofs in natural language or ones who think that mathematics should be done by AI, but I don't think that these are positions held in general by the ITP community, or that they are even the main reasons why people are interested in ITP. <br>\nThis may in part be due to the running theme of his blog, with ITP being just one of multiple areas that he's commenting on from the same perspective, thus limiting the scope. </p>\n<p>I'd also be more sympathetic to the article if the points were made less rhetorically (i.e. they'd read less like an LSD trip :-)), and I didn't feel like I'm spending more time trying to understand the points in the article than the author spent time writing it.</p>",

Then realizing that AC and replacement are compatible with Univalence but global choice isn’t, this casts doubt on Mario’s argument in his thesis which seems to prove that one can get global choice in ZFC plus countably many large cardinals?

        "content": "<p>Hi! Sorry, I barely open zulip anymore these days.</p>\n<p>I can summarize the main points of the discussion here. In your thesis it is clear: You assume large enough cardinals to obtain universes <code>V_0,...,V_omega</code>, so that every type in the i-th universe is in <code>Vi</code>. By the axiom of choice, there exists a choice function that selects an element of every inhabited set in <code>V_ω</code>. Then I put my type-theory hat on again, to see if I could understand the argument from the type theoretic point of view. </p>\n<p>Since we're here on the Lean zulip, let's assume that every type is a set. The axiom of choice asserts that <code>(∀(x:X), ∥Y(x)∥) → ∥Π(x:X), Y(x)∥</code>for every type <code>X</code> and every family of types <code>Y</code> over <code>X</code>. Applying this to <code>V_ω</code> we get that <code>(Π (X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → ∥X∥) → ∥Π(X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → X∥</code>. This is also how you apply it in your thesis. The thing I thought was a problem was that you only seem to get ∥Π(X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → X∥, but to interpret Lean's global choice you want <code>Π(X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → X</code>. Then Andrej pointed out that actually you're not _constructing_ a model, but you're proving that a model exists. This cleared up the discussion to me, but do you also see it this way?</p>",

        "content": "<p>In other parts of the discussion I was wondering what would be needed in type theory to get an implication <code>AC → Global-Choice</code>. </p>\n<p>Andrej was very confused about what I wanted and suggested erroneously that this is possible in CIC. It is not. The argument here is as follows: The axiom of choice is consistent with the univalence axiom, but the global choice principle is not consistent with the univalence axiom. This implies that if we could simply prove global choice from AC, then in combination with univalence we would be able to reach a contradiction. Furthermore, any axiom that is compatible with the univalence axiom also won't help you prove global choice from AC. This leads to the question, what extra assumptions do we need to make about type theory in order for your argument to go through in type theory. I still don't know the answer. The suggestions by Andrej in that thread were not helpful. </p>\n<p>So that is a summary of the other part of the discussion.</p>",

The Annals was originally going to publish a disclaimer to the proof stating that it wasn't sure it was entirely correct and they would no longer accept proofs like this, but they later decided against it.

But LTE didn't just produce that: the Lean code for each individual lemma is human-readable with a modicum of practice, and the LTE blueprint is a completely human-readable account with cross-linkage to the underlying Lean code. (If the only thing that LTE had left behind for posterity was a huge bundle of gibberish-to-humans low-level output of the kind that's fed to <code>trepplein</code>, then the criticism would have more weight. All of us here know that's not the case, but I don't think Andrew realises that.)</p>\n<p>So the appropriate comparison isn't \"I explained the proof to Ofer Gabber and he said he believed it\".

Participants had to implement an API with endpoints to create, query and search for 'people' (a kind of CRUD without UPDATE and DELETE). In the tournament, participants still had to deal with CPU and memory constraints – each participant had to deliver the API in docker-compose format and could only use 1.5 CPU units and 3GB of memory.</p>\n</blockquote>",

And many people find this answer disappointing because starting a language is a long hard task especially if it's to be a sophisticated one. And so people ask for a candidate project they might join and help instead. And my best suggestion for a while now has been Lean 4.

        "content": "<p>I usually mention Jeremy's formalisation of the prime number theorem in 2004, arguing that it's a great early example of a nontrivial result (uses the discrete and the continuous) which proves that the systems work. LTE I usually sell as \"the fundamental theorem of liquid vector spaces\" or \"a result saying that certain higher Ext groups vanish in the category of condensed abelian groups\". Perfectoid spaces the main contribution was the definition and I often mention it straight after the odd order (Feit-Thompson) theorem: Feit-Thompson was 300+ pages of group theory proving a result which was a major contributor to Thompson winning his Fields Medal in 1970, which I describe as a \"complex theorem about simple objects\" (similar to the prime number theorem, the four colour theorem and the Kepler conjecture); the perfectoid project, if you want a theorem then we proved that the empty set was a perfectoid space, which is a very simple theorem about complex objects (of course it's not actually a theorem, it's also a definition, but mathematicians are already confused enough about the difference between a definition and a theorem that I don't stress this fact). Finally I argue that Bhavik's recent work (Bloom-Mehta formalising Bloom's proof of an old conjecture of Erdos and Graham, finished before the paper was refereed, and then his formalisation over the summer of the breakthrough new result in Ramsey theory <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2023/11/04/formalising-modern-research-mathematics-in-real-time/\">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2023/11/04/formalising-modern-research-mathematics-in-real-time/</a> , again before the paper had been refereed) as an argument that in some areas of mathematics, real time formalisation is now possible. I then contrast this against modern algebraic number theory, where we are still a very long way off even stating recent results, because the definition of a canonical model of a Shimura variety needs class field theory and many other things as inputs, so is probably 1000+ pages away (although the FLT project will dent this number a bit), and any proofs about Shimura varieties are hundreds more pages after that.</p>",

The preceding paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While there are several types of formal methods that span a range of techniques and stages in the<br>\nsoftware development process, this report highlights a few specific examples. Sound static analysis<br>\nexamines the software for specific properties without executing the code.xxi This method is<br>\neffective because it can be used across many representations of software, including the source code,<br>\narchitecture, requirements, and executables. Model checkers can answer questions about a number<br>\nof higher-level properties.xxii These algorithms can be used during production; however, they are<br>\nlimited in their scaled use due to their computational complexity. Assertion-based testing is a<br>\nformal statement of properties carried in the code that may be used to cross-check the code during<br>\ntesting or production.xxiii These generated proofs allow for faults to be detected much earlier and<br>\ncloser to the erroneous code, rather than tracing back from externally visible systems failures.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The problem is that the argument is insanely detailed and any paper text has something wrong with it.  This can be attributed partly to deficiencies of mine as an expositor, but since I was the only one who saw it, I had to do the writing.  It is also intrinsic:  there is a lot of elaborate and not necessarily intuitive bookkeeping in the argument, and its very easy to write things down wrong.  I am sure now that (1) the Lean proof is correct, I read the statements of the conclusions, and it proves the right thing and (2) the paper as it stands is converging to the right thing, because Sky is advising me where what I do differs from what is done in the formal proof, and she appears to follow what I have written now fairly happily.</p>",

Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) können beispielsweise checken, ob vorgelegte Beweise korrekt sind oder nicht. Hierzu muss der mathematische Beweis in die Sprache des ITPs übersetzt – oder formalisiert – werden. In diesem Vortrag versuche ich, in einen ITP (Lean4) einzuführen, und anhand eines Beispiels aus einer Grundvorlesung aufzuzeigen, wie eine solche Formalisierung aussehen kann. Dabei bleibt eine mögliche Formalisierung nicht bei Grundlagen der Mathematik stehen, wie man etwa an Projekten zu perfektoiden Räumen oder dem Beweis der Fermat'schen Vermutung sieht.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In proving this on paper, Canonne et al . [13] make use of Fourier analysis and the Poisson summation formula, and we are not aware of any simple, alternate proof that avoids this technical machinery. Fortunately, Mathlib’s comprehensive library already includes the relevant theorems from Fourier analysis to replicate this proof. Using Mathlib, we were able to fully formalize this zCDP result from first principles with reasonable proof effort.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Whenever I recognized a novel idea, whether correct or only partially so, I distilled the key insight and prompted ChatGPT to develop it further.</p>\n<p>My contribution:<br>\n - Filtering out incorrect arguments and accumulating a set of correct facts. <br>\n - Identifying promising new lines of reasoning and guiding ChatGPT to explore them further <br>\n - Recognizing when a strategy had been fully explored and deciding when to move on. </p>\n<p>ChatGPT's contribution: <br>\n - Producing the final proof argument.<br>\n - Significantly accelerating my (or our) exploration of the many dead-end arguments, rapidly ruling out approaches that did not work.</p>\n<p>Plans forward:<br>\nIn my view, this result is already publishable in a respectable optimization theory journal.

Quite a few people have told me that the secret of dependent types is knowing when <strong>not</strong> to use them. And so, to me, they have too much in common with Tesla’s <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/10/29/tesla-full-self-driving-v14-disappoints-with-hallucinations-brake-stabbing-speeding/\">Full Self-Driving</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io//2025/11/02/Why-not-dependent.html\">\"Why don't you use dependent types?\"</a> by <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"131965\">Lawrence Paulson</span>  (and its accompanying <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45790827\">current HN comments</a>.)</p>",

Each step is a triplet (state, tactic, return), where the return depends on the distance to proof end. These are taken from human-written proofs in Mathlib, but require quite a bit of preprocessing - you can read more about that in my LeanTree paper (<a href=\"https://t.co/pwCfCNG0fD\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14722</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>LEAN<br>\nThere is a lot going on when interacting with the actual \"RL environment\" of Lean, since the language wasn't built for tree search (where, e.g., some branches of the proof can be solved independently if they don't share a metavariable). You also want to maintain a pool of Lean processes because importing Mathlib takes a few seconds. All of this is handled by LeanTree (<a href=\"https://t.co/Zw8xnzP1cJ\">https://github.com/kripner/leantree</a>), which extends the semi-official Lean REPL and also provides HTTP endpoints for starting proofs and running tactics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>RL<br>\nIn the RL loop, the prover tries to prove theorems from an autoformalized corpus and adds successful proofs to a replay buffer. The policy/value model is then trained using a mix of 90% transitions sampled from the buffer and 10% from Mathlib. Instead of running the autoformalization from scratch, I'm using LeanWorkbook - a dataset of 25k autoformalized theorems.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I sometimes hear people talk as if settling the controversy would require formalizing all of IUTT, but that's not really the case.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Honestly I'm not even sure it's that critical that the lemma be proved; it seems like the major stumbling block is even just understanding what the definitions are</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The definitions required to <em>state</em> Corollary 3.12 are not the biggest stumbling block. It's the proof that is the sticking point. What Scholze and Stix have argued is that the most natural ways of interpreting the proof do not (and indeed cannot) yield Corollary 3.12. That leaves open the possibility of some other interpretation, but it's hard to estimate how much work it would require to nail down that interpretation (or conclude that there is an irremediable gap).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>or it will make it possible to make the Scholze-Stix counterexample more accurate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure that this will help resolve the controversy. Roughly speaking, what they argued was, \"If you strip away a bunch of this machinery to create a simplified setting, then we get a contradiction. And it doesn't seem that any of this machinery can possibly block this contradiction.\" It's not really in dispute that the argument in the simplified setting (what I think you're calling the \"Scholze-Stix counterexample\") is correct. Mochizuki's objection is that the simplification is an oversimplification that misses the whole point of the machinery.</p>",
