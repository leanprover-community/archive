It seems to me that there is no simple way to use about partial derivatives at the moment, am I incorrect (and if so what is this simple way)? And if I am not incorrect, is defining partial derivatives something that would be extraordinarily difficult, or just something that no one has gotten around to doing? Thank you in advance for your input.</p>",
