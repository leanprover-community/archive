They are always simple linear functions in Nat with Nat multiplier and constant, but aren't always this kind of obvious series.  I want to prove that these collectively generate the whole of Nat, possibly with overlap. I don't always have 3 linear functions, but so far I think it is always a small number of cases. Is there some strategy I should be reaching for to automate this, or do I write it down as something like: <code>\\all n : Nat, n = 3a or n = 3a+1 or n = 3a+2</code>? I could use each expression to indue a set, take their union and prove that it is or it contains Nat perhaps?</p>",
