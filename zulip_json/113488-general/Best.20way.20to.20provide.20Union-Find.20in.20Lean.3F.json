The paper <a href=\"https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ftp/publis/puf-wml07.pdf\">A Persistent Union-Find Data Structure</a> suggests the following functional interface (translated to Lean by me):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"n\">UnionFind</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">uf</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">create</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">BEq</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">uf</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">find</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">BEq</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">uf</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">union</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">BEq</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">uf</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">uf</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The problem with this interface is that it only has an efficient implementation in an impure language, where we can sneak path-compression imperatively behind the scene.</p>\n<p>Do we have any guideline for the cleanest way to provide the Union-Find data structure in a pure FP language, specifically Lean?</p>\n<p>Thanks!!</p>",
