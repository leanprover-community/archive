I added '\\usepackage{depgraph}' to a basic latex file, but the file was not compiled by saying \"no depgraph.sty found\". When I read more about plastex, as far as I understand, I should compile the latex file via plastex + adding plastexdepgraph. But I don't know how to do so. Do I have a misunderstanding? Sorry if it's very silly mistake :)</p>",
