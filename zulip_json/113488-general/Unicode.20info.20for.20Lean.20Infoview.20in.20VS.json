For example, when I hover over <code>∑</code> in <code>∑ i, f i • (g i : M) = m</code>, the last part of hover text in a lean file is \"Type <code>∑</code> using <code>\\sum</code>\", but there is no such text in the goal viewer. I stumbled a bit over this as I tried to use the shortcut <code>\\sigma</code> and got <code>Σ</code> instead, leading to a bit of confusing over the type error I got.</p>",
