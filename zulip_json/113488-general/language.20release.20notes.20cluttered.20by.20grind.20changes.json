I have no complaints about those improvements and changes themselves, but since i'm not interested in using grind for the forseeable future, reading the releasenotes to find changes i'm interested in is becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming.<br>\nBecause of this, i'd like to ask if it is possible to create a separate header or subheader for changes to <code>grind</code>, so people know where to start/stop reading, depending on their interests?</p>",
