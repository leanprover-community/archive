        "content": "<p>I think the new website having more images, icons, and dividers will ultimately be a good thing because it means that people are putting more effort into designing the site. I’ve also seen quite a few other websites use images of blurred, nearly white background blocks on the homepage to make the page less monotonous.</p>\n<p>As for areas that need improvement, people have already mentioned that the web layout needs to adapt to mobile devices, not just laptops.</p>\n<p>I’d like to add that I think a general principle is that maintaining consistency on a webpage is very important, which encompasses several of the issues people have raised before. It's like repeating a wrong sentence hundreds of times in different situations and it starts to sound like the truth. I find it interesting that consistency is more important than it seems. It makes the site appear far more symmetrical and serious.</p>\n<p>In most places, we should use the same background color, rounded corner radius, shadows, spacing, and dividers. Font type, size, color, and alignment should be as uniform as possible. Try to use icons from the same icon library so that their style, complexity, and size remain consistent. Try to use vector graphics as much as possible instead of images. </p>\n<p>(Especially, all blocks should either all have shadows or none; either all have rounded corners or none. From what I know, many large websites simply use the most common fonts, such as Arial, but I think using other fonts is also fine.)</p>\n<p>In many cases, it is enough to just use black, white, and gray, along with varying opacities of a single primary theme color, like blue/green/yellow/purple. This is especially true for large color blocks like buttons. </p>\n<p>If you need to break this rule of consistency and apply different styles to elements, you should have a reason for doing so. Perhaps the nature of the two elements is different, and they are not parallel, and you need to hint this to the user. Of course, I also think that for website prototypes, there is no need to care about any of these.</p>\n<p>The text at the top of the page should be the shortest and most core content. As the user scrolls down, the text should gradually delve into more details. </p>\n<p>For HTML, I think using Tailwind CSS for debugging is the most efficient way to go. You can directly modify class names and immediately see the improvements, instead of having to go through several steps like with native CSS. ChatGPT is actually also very good at writing decent small web pages using Tailwind.</p>\n<p>Since someone mentioned accessibility, I’d like to say that I’m not sure why the fonts used on the Theorem Proving in Lean webpages are not black but instead a gray color like <code>rgb(51,51,51)</code>. I always felt that my eyes got slightly more strained when reading this book. I think Functional Programming in Lean book uses the same website generator as TPIL, but its text is pure black.</p>",

My understanding is that in other languages, the proof libraries are nowhere near as unified, except maybe Isabelle's AFP.</li>\n<li>Lean has good support for classical reasoning, whereas most other proof assistants try to remain constructive as long as possible. I would ere on the side of caution about trying to make this a selling point though, because the people who know what classical vs constructive logic is are more likely to be the same people who want to work constructively. But maybe there's some point in trying to explain how Lean is mathematician-friendly, while at the same time not turning away anyone.</li>\n<li>Lean has good tooling (<code>lake</code> and <code>elan</code>) and good editor integration.
