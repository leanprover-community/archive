This problem would be much worse for lean because \"parsing the whole project\" is already equivalent to a full build.</p>",

Lake would very much like to just elaborate the file itself (to easily solve things like <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lake/pull/86\">lake#86</a>). The reason the imports are pre-parsed and fixed at the top is due to restrictions of the Lean <code>Environment</code>.
