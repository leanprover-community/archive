The Lean4 versions show that this has been changed to be the word <code>Nat</code>, and the symbolic alias only exists within Mathlib. As well as ℤ.</p>\n<p>1) why was that? <br>\n2) I think the symbolic aliases should also be in the standard lib. There are general purpose software engineers who still find symbols to improve readability, especially when we are still already using lots of other symbols like <code>\\alpha</code> and <code>\\mapsto</code> and <code>\\lambda</code> throughout our code, it's more consistent. I wouldn't want to download and import mathlib all the time just to get these symbols back.</p>",

It's not worth it.
