Among other things, we're interested in how AI systems might try to make sense of what you're doing, in ways parallel, or oblique, to your own journey.</p>\n<p>We would be very grateful if people would be willing to share links to Github repos where they've been writing code. Ideally, these would be </p>\n<p>(1) smaller personal projects, so we can see how individuals or small groups develop ideas over time, potentially in a playful or self-teaching mode.</p>\n<p>(2) projects where at least some of the code is, indeed, finished — a theorem is proved, definitions are constructed and probed — so that we can get a sense of where the project was (at least by the end) intended to go.</p>\n<p>(3) things you think are particularly interesting or creative — even if the project didn't reach the ultimate desired form.</p>\n<p>We do not need super-proficient Lean gurus! — beginners and hobbyists would be lovely. For example, Iif you're teaching a course where students are keeping their projects in a Github, this could be ideal, or if you were using Lean for something adventurous as a passion project. Right now we're not sure how to handle larger projects where there are pull requests, administrators, and so on, but we're hoping eventually to scale up to big things like mathlib.</p>\n<p>If you're willing to share, the only thing we need is that the Github project be set to \"public\" so that we can see it (otherwise we'd need to get ethics clearance.)</p>\n<p>Please share them here, or if you like, by e-mail to sdedeo[at]andrew.cmu.edu ; and please don't be shy.</p>",
