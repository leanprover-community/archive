Behind the scenes, a structure that inherits from another structure contains an instance of the original structure as a field. In other words, inheritance is implemented with composition. When multiple inheritance is used, only the unique fields from the additional parent structures are used to avoid a diamond problem, and the functions that would normally extract the parent value are instead organized to construct one. Record dot notation takes structure inheritance into account.\"</p>",
