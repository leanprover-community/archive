But the manner of expression of the historical events in the existing work is not something you can copy.<br>\nMathematical expressions I believe falls under the same kind of thinking. One can creatively express a formula, say as an artwork presenting the equation as a giant graffiti tag, and this expression has copyrightable content. Assembling formal proofs of a list of theorems feels to me like assembling your own history book, but IANAL.<br>\nAlso, while one might argue that the flow of the sequence of definitions and theorems etc is a specific expression, the formalisation is almost surely not going to be an identical sequence of definitions and theorems, and moreover the manner of expression is a very large transformation, not merely something like translating text from one human language to another.
