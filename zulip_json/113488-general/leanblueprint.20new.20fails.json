A quick explanation is that as I said I was suspicious of your directory name. You had something that said <code>weierstrass-p-function-main</code> as your directory name. Usually in git this indicates that you've used something like <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree\"><code>git worktree</code></a> but I assumed you wouldn't be using that unless you knew what it did, so it's more likely something that was clicked in VSCode ran that kind of operation for you. And in that state, gitpython (which leanblueprint uses) wasn't able to understand what you had. As part of you pushing your repo you must have clicked something which got you back to a normal git repository state which I could tell because I saw the <code>-main</code> disappeared. But I don't know enough about VSCode to be able to tell you which button to avoid I'm afraid. I think you should be good to go now though!</p>",
