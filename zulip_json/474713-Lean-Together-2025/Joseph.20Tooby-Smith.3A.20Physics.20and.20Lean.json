There are many things in physics that only have computational proofs and I don't think they can be ignored.

For instance, a paper or textbook might have a derivation, but it doesn’t specify the types of any variables, what are premises vs intermediate statements, etc. It’s sometimes a novel and valuable task to informally answer these kinds of questions before starting to work on formalizing it. Formalizing might also prompt you to address these kinds of questions, too.</p>",
