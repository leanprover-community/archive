However, these performance gains are mainly to be found in the preprocessing and proof reconstruction steps (in Lean), which usually aren't the bottleneck. When a proof takes multiple seconds to complete, this usually means that the equality saturation step in the egg backend took that long. And since the egg library is already extremely performant, we could only hope to improve performance there by being smarter about which rewrites we generate/select, and keeping the data we pass into the e-graph as small as possible.</p>\n<p>That said, equality saturation tends to have the property that it either completes relatively quickly, or never manages to prove a goal at all (cf. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3632900\">this paper</a>). That's why we set the default time limit for equality saturation at 3 seconds, so I guess it's arguable whether that's \"fast\".</p>",

We have a separate Lake project in <code>Lean/Egg/Test/Math</code> for tests which should depend on mathlib.

Or if you want to look at the code in an editor, open <em>that</em> directory instead of the root <code>lean-egg</code> directory.

I just don't know how hard it is to turn an egg explanation into a sequence of <code>rw</code>s. In general we can't just use <code>rw</code> with the given lemma and rewrite direction. We would sometimes also have to determine at which occurrence (as in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Lean.Meta.Occurrences#doc\">docs#Lean.Meta.Occurrences</a>) to <code>rw</code>. And other times we would have to explicitly specify some of the arguments to the lemma.
