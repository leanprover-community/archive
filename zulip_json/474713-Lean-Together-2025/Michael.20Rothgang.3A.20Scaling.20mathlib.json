Alex Best's <a href=\"https://researchseminars.org/talk/LeanTogether2024/9/\">leaff</a> tool is Lean-aware and a robust version, so using it would be a fantastic improvement.</li>\n<li>Joachim Breitner wrote a tool to check the local confluence of simp lemmas.

See <a href=\"https://github.com/jcommelin/queueboard/issues\">open issues page</a> has some ideas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>a specific idea: use the queueboard data to create a zulip bot posting about one issue per day which should be triaged.</li>\n<li>what does it take to make leaff usable in mathlib?
