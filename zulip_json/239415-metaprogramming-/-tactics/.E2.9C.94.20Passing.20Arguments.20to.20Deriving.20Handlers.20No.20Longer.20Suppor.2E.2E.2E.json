The <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest//Type-Classes/Deriving-Instances/#Lean___Elab___registerDerivingHandler\">chapter on deriving handlers</a> in the language reference mentions that <code>DerivingHandlers</code> can take on optional arguments passed after the <code>with</code> keyword, e.g. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\">-- Here, `fooArgs` is passed as an argument to the deriving handler associated with `Foo`</span>\n<span class=\"n\">deriving</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">instance</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Foo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">with</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">fooArgs</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">for</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Bar</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Baz</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>However, examining <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5265\">this PR</a>, it seems like that passing arguments to deriving handlers is no longer supported. </p>\n<p>I also looked at the source code of various existing handlers (e.g. <code>deriving BEq</code>) and it seems like none of them take in arguments via the <code>with</code> keyword. </p>\n<p>I was wondering if this feature has been deprecated, and if so, whether the language reference has yet to be updated? Thanks!</p>",
