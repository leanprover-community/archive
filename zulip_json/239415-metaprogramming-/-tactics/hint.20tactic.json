I was initially thinking of just having a <code>finish</code> tactic that would have the finish and suggest tactic categories. However, if there isn't a tactic that combines <code>finish</code> and <code>hint</code>, people would run both anyway.</li>\n<li>Does this configuration make sense?</li>\n</ol>",
