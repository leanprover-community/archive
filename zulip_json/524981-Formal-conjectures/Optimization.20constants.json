(EDIT: Note this is not a Lean repository, but rather aims to serve as an overview.)<br>\nPer discussion at <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/optimizationproblems/issues/10\">this</a>, it may be nice to add Lean formalisations to definitions (and bounds etc) of constants defined there, similar as it is being done for <a href=\"https://teorth.github.io/erdosproblems/\">Erdos problems</a>. Note the numbering system of the constants is still not stabilized. Most of the constants are likely also more difficult to formalise than Erdos problems.<br>\nThe formal conjectures repository would probably be suitable for this endeavor.</p>\n<p>I was thinking each constant should have the definition, formalisation of best known lower and upper bounds, answer(sorry) for a lower and upper bound as well as conjectures about the constants if they exist.</p>\n<p>Would this make sense to add (as its own folder)?</p>",

You can have things that are hard to formalize because of long chains of missing definitions but where those definitions are themselves quite elementary; you can also have cases where the definitions are not at all elementary, or where writing down good definitions (or proving those definitions make sense) itself depends on proving lots of theorems. You can also have cases where the problem isn't writing down some formal definitions that work for a specific conjecture, but producing <em>good</em> and general definitions that are reasonable to work with in a formal context. And then you can have things that are very hard and non-elementary to prove but easy and elementary to state (like FLT) - but when formalizing a conjecture, you don't know what would be involved in a solution.</p>",
