I would love to hear your thoughts on whether this kind of tagging would be a welcome addition to the workflow!</p>",

The solved variants (and solved problems) act as an progression for judging how good a AI system is on a given problem and how good it can utilize the information from the literature to formalize the proof of the solved variant. In this vein only the categorization of open and solved is important any further information can be tracked via docstrings and variants I would say. </p>\n<p>Tracking problem status is not the general goal of the project, but a small byproduct of maintaining its function of a proper benchmark consisting of open problems. Thats my view of the project, but I am open to be corrected.</p>",
