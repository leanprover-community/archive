What are peoples thoughts on the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do questions about algorithms belong in formal-conjectures?</li>\n<li>Do questions about  complexity classes belong in formal-conjectures?</li>\n<li>If we do want problems about complexity classes, should we attempt to add the concept of complexity classes to mathlib first so that the definitions don't need to be placed in the formal conjectures repository?</li>\n<li>Alternatively, should we try to add these definitions to the relatively new CSLib project and add a dependency on that?</li>\n</ul>",

We already have questions that go more towards the computer science direction, for instance <a href=\"https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/blob/main/FormalConjectures/Other/BeaverMathOlympiad.lean\">https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/blob/main/FormalConjectures/Other/BeaverMathOlympiad.lean</a></p>\n<p>The stuff you proposed could make great contributions! <br>\nI'm not sure if we want to add the corresponding definitions/api to our <code>ForMathlib</code> first or if we should introduce a <code>ForCSLib</code> and later also depend on it, I suppose it depends on what exactly will be added. I don't think there are strong reasons not to add a dependency to <code>CSLib</code> when needed.</p>",
