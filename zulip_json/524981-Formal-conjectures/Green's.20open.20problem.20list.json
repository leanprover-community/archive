Some of the problems are repeated from the Erdos problems (like <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/510\">#510</a> being the same as <a href=\"https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/greenbj/papers/open-problems.pdf#section.11\">81</a> on the pdf) but a lot are new problems I hadn't heard of. I'm planning on adding each problem not covered by the Erdos problems as individual issues (when it isn't so late for me)</p>",
