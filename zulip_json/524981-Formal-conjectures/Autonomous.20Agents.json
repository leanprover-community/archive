It ingests the issue content and then makes a suggested solution. The Thing is that this pipeline seems to be bugged, it commented in less than a second on the issue, far less than it would need for the inference and we can also deduce this because the \"proposed Solution\" is actually empty.</p>\n<p>So in a nutshell, we now have AI Slop Software used to distribute / annoy people with more AI Slop.</p>",
