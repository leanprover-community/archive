Are you sure that posters work? Can you somehow slide into their DMs? Are they on huge Whatsapp chat groups for example?</p>\n<p>Second reason (absolutely key): I had a really interesting project which I was highly focussed on, namely \"make this 30,000 line pile of triviality about finite sets called mathlib into something which contains some interesting undergraduate mathematics: for example, make the complex numbers, make matrices and prove that square matrices are a ring, prove quadratic reciprocity, develop field theory, prove insolvability of the quintic, prove that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x) from the axioms of mathematics, prove e^{i.theta}=cos(theta)+i.sin(theta), prove that every natural number is the sum of 4 squares...\" . This was really crucial: I had many projects, which ranged from easy to difficult, and students chose projects and self-assembled into small groups in order to solve them. I managed to instill into these students the importance of building an amazing mathematics library and, with the help of many other people from around the world, mathlib started turning into the thing which I was convinced that the mathematics community needed (even though at that time I was extremely unclear on exactly <em>why</em> it needed it). When it started to become clear that one could actually get publications out of our work I think that this became an even more exciting motivator for the students (about 5 of them ended up with publications as undergrads).</p>\n<p>If you want to grow at Bristol (and for sure your undergrads are bright enough for this to be possible) then you might want to think about how to solve those two problems. The first is pretty easy to solve: you start asking undergraduates how to pass messages to everyone and you start asking those who teach big undergraduate classes if you can advertise something for 1 minute at the start/end of their lecture. The second one is more subtle: you have to decide what you're advertising. My experience from 2022 post-covid, where my message was \"come to my Lean club, undergraduates, because Lean is kind of cool\" was not coherent enough; 1st year undergraduates would show up, say \"I want to contribute to mathlib\" and I would say \"oh crap, all that stuff that undergraduates were doing in 2018 is done now and basically what mathlib needs now is either a job for someone who's already a technical expert or involves graduate level algebra, which you don't know because you're a first year; personally I am becoming interested in proving FLT and you're not much help there either.\". My message had become very weak and indeed the undergraduates stopped coming to the club, which is now basically a weekly social evening for graduate students and post-docs working in the area of formalization. </p>\n<p>Laura, my impression is that you had some interesting formalization project ideas. You might want to consider a \"launch event\" where you give a lecture explaining a project and explaining how undergraduates can help, and stressing that this might well turn into a paper; also note that people are predicting that 2026 will be the year of the AI autoformalizer, which might get some people excited; a lot of kids are interested in AI, despite the fact that it currently writes crappy code. If you have a vision for a project or projects which are suitable for 1st years, which might lead to publications, and where you just feel like you need some extra hands, then I would focus on advertising that project/those projects and seeing what you get. At the end of the day there is ample evidence that a really good way to become a Lean power user is by working on a project and then having your code reviewed by someone else; forget the textbooks. If you are able to find a mathematically interesting project with parts which are accessible to undergraduates then this might be the hook for BLUE.</p>",

I think that for a proof you have to decide \"do I want this to be done by a human or will I be content with it being done by a machine\" and for FLT I am currently toying with the idea that I should offer up some of the 1980s stuff to AI companies; if their proof compiles, is crap, and then breaks after a mathlib bump and if AI can't fix it then who cares, I'll just go back to sorrying the result because I'm allowed to do that as part of the FLT project remit.</p>",
