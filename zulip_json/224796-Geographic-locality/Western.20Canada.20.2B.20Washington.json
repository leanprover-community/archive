I'm faculty at North Island College on Vancouver Island, but that particular role isn't too relevant to Lean (I teach in a vocational diploma program for web and mobile app developers). However, I am also simultaneously completing a (second) MSc at UVic where I'm working on a Lean-based project in cryptography. I don't think anyone else is doing anything with Lean at UVic, but would be interested to discuss further to see how I can help out.</p>",

Just a bit more context: I’m thinking about applying to run one of these <a href=\"https://courses.pims.math.ca\">PIMS network graduate courses</a>   about formalizing pure mathematics using lean.

If you would be interested in such a course (or know of someone who will), please let me know!</p>",
