I don't know if it's because I'm still getting used to the <code>.fold</code> pattern as a substitute for <code>for</code> loops, or if there's a better best practice.</li>\n<li>A few things I instinctively reached for that I expected would be in the standard library weren't. Hashset difference operations, numpy-like array operations like <code>.sum()</code>, etc. I assume the standard library is still being built out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A few things I loved:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using <code>by omega</code> to prove a list/array index was in bounds; it's so easy.</li>\n<li>Pinning <code>#eval</code> lines in the lean infoview. I could really quickly write functions by leaving out the function return type, and constantly seeing what the function was returning on sample data as I built it up. Seeing the in-progress data structure removes a lot of mental effort as I built up functions</li>\n<li>Chaining pipe operators. Combined with using #eval, it's really easy to visualize the data flow with all the pipes on their own line.
