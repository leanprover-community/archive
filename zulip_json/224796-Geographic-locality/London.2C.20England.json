We thought we'd now go public; the next meeting is a week on Friday at Imperial.</p>\n<p>When: Friday 28th Feb 4-6pm (refreshments at 4, presentations start 4:30, bar at 6pm)<br>\nWhere: Huxley Building room 341, Imperial College London</p>\n<p>Anyone considering presenting: you don't have to prepare pdf slides or anything, people just plug in their laptop and display Lean code and chat about it and write on a whiteboard if necessary.</p>",

So this time we're giving people the opportunity to let me know beforehand if they want to reserve a slot. Bhavik also suggested that instead of 10 minutes for talks and 5 minutes for questions we should have 9 minutes for talks and 1 minute for questions, so we can increase the number of talks (because people can ask their questions down the pub afterwards). Whether or not this becomes a reality will probably depend on how many people contact me asking to reserve a ten minute slot!</p>",
