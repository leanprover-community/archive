Staff Common Room, which is room 549 of the maths department (5th floor). This is now only accessible if you have a card, or if someone else lets you in, so please feel free to DM me (or bang on the door) if you are stuck outside! At 5pm we will retire down to the 1st floor and meet in 140. </p>\n<p>Reminder: the session is \"show and tell\", with 10-minute slots where people are free to show off fresh stuff/demos. As ever, if you want a 10-minute slot (especially if you're not an Imperial person and/or we've not seen your work already) then feel free to let me know and I'll reserve one for you.</p>",
