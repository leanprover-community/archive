We though Lean might be more interesting than just going over a computer algebra system, and it might be more of a level starting point since Lean could be quite different to the sorts of languages the students are most likely to have met before.</p>\n<p>David and I are just starting out learning Lean ourselves, so the course will be very student led and collaborative. A reasonable goal for the course would be that participants learn how to interact with the Lean environment, and to access the existing library of mathematics, and that by the end we are able to venture into proving new theorems (i.e. translating known theorems from our discipline) into the library. So we will probably start with some tutorials and then move more towards some project-based work.</p>\n<p>We are still at the stage of planning how exactly the course will run. I wanted to touch base here since I'm aware, via Jon Eugster, that there are quite a few Lean experts mainly based in Informatics. Let me know if you have any thoughts, suggestions for teaching, project ideas, or any other interest in this pilot course.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Patrick</p>",

The first club meeting I will be giving an intro talk to Lean and theorem proving for first years and people wondering what this Lean stuff is - I'm by no means an expert but someone has to spread the gospel. The Lean club is being run by the maths society and typesig, a special interest group of the computer science society.<br>\nIt would be great to meet you, whether it be at the club or elsewhere :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hi Alex!</p>\n<p>I'm working with <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"384425\">Wenda Li</span>. </p>\n<p>I've gone to a bunch of TypeSIG stuff already and am looking forward to the Lean workshops -- you're the first one to tell me when they are actually happening lol. Are you with CompSoc, or are you on the maths side?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh cool, I think someone mentioned a PhD student went to the pub social!</p>\n<p>An announcement will be made soon in the server hehe, was just figuring out details of when/where and pizza <span aria-label=\"pizza\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f355\" role=\"img\" title=\"pizza\">:pizza:</span> - I am on the committee for Typesig (so yes CompSoc, was in the MathSoc committe last year) as I intend to organise the Lean Club throughout the year.</p>",
