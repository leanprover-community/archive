I am in Charleston SC and would enjoy collaborating on a Lean project. I've been trying to start up a Lean meetup group in Charleston, we meet every second Tuesday of the month at the Charleston Tech Center at 5:30pm. For December's meeting, we are planning on doing some of the new Advent of Code exercises together. Let me know if you would like to hear more about it. Nice to meet you!</p>",
