The resulting call to <code>linear_combination</code> has a size of 23MB. I’m not sure if I call that reasonable :-)</p>\n<p>When you say “at least in sage”, are the terms there smaller? In other words, does it explode already before we emit the <code>linear_combination</code> syntax, or is that size unavoidable?</p>\n<p>To scale this up to larger proofs one probably has to do something similar to how the sat-integration in <code>bv_decide</code> works, where you can store the certificate in a separate file that then read back in a tactic (replacing <code>linear_combination</code>) and a fair amount of engineering that this file can be parsed and checked efficiently.</p>\n<p>With the current design I don’t think there is an easy fix to scale it to such large terms.</p>",

He cannot talk before March 31st, so it would be nice to do something in the mean time. One possible topic is to continue the meta-programming series that we started a while ago (we did only one meeting about this, so it will be rather easy to catch up for people who didn’t get the first talk). I think it’s good to keep the early Monday afternoon slot which works for many people. I created a poll at <a href=\"https://evento.renater.fr/survey/lean-talks-in-orsay-2d8lamsl\">https://evento.renater.fr/survey/lean-talks-in-orsay-2d8lamsl</a> to see which Mondays are good in the near future.

Our building and our activities are not open to people who have nothing to do with the university (not working or studying there), and are not invited by university employees.

They are not designed for the general public, and attending them as external person would not make sense. This is pretty universal across universities, by the way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hello. I am very confused. I have a strong MATH for REASEARCH very specific background in theorem prooving. 950 / 1000 engineers die before having this background I permit myself to ask why you think I could not join.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>case 1 : the meet is closed to public ? : Then why is there a map for each university of france ? If it is really private, I do not see any issue but WHY showing ALL places to a map? It is not privatelhy relate! I just would like to clarify.</li>\n<li>case 2: why was stated out my knowledge about my publications / blog  and academic work? I am absolutely surprised to see it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these elements let me think you do not like my registration because of my nick. In euro, privacy is a fundamental right. I shall no dox myself. Sorry. I am also surpised to see people who post their names (might be real one) in this public forum. Sounds creepy and dangrous!!!</p>",

I've been involved in contexts where many if not most go by a pseudonym. Yet, I work on mathlib contributions full-time, so this account is my work persona. Using my real name there has clear benefits, such as people being able to recognise me.)</li>\n<li>Universities have externals visitors or guests regularly. (One example is <a href=\"https://europroofnet.github.io/WG4_Orsay25/\">this recent conference</a>.) It's much easier if they have a map to the building they're supposed to go to. They are not secret places (and neither should they, in my opinion).</li>\n<li>That does not imply everybody is the target audience for every meeting. (Indeed, this is not the case.)</li>\n</ul>",
