        "content": "<p>OK I'll bite, even though I don't really know what's going on (but there's no reason not to learn).</p>\n<p>So this channel (which I'm only subscribed to because I'm subscribed to all channels) is all about keeping a branch of mathlib up to date with a branch of lean, right? In particular it's not a PR to master, it's a PR to a branch called <code>bump/v4.14.0</code>. And then once a month lean updates and mathlib updates all at the same time and this branch is presumably a key component in that (I speak as a mathlib user who in the past has not really paid any attention to this, I've just regarded the entire monthly bump as magic). </p>\n<p>Looking at the PR, the vast majority of it seems to be a renaming of <code>List.pure</code> to <code>List.singleton</code> and <code>List.bind</code> to <code>List.flatMap</code> and I'm assuming that this is not something which we are discussing here, this is some decision which has already been made in core lean (which I don't follow really) and we are just adapting to this change in mathlib. Here I've just checked (modulo any errors on my part) that every mathlib lemma with a new name has been deprecated properly (e.g. <code>map_append_bind_perm</code> has now become <code>map_append_flatMap_perm</code> etc etc). </p>\n<p>Other than that, we seem to have an exciting new proof that <code>BitVec w</code> is a <code>CommRing</code>, which surprises me because I thought that we were trying to purge bitvecs from mathlib a few months ago, but on the other hand if someone wants them to be a CommRing then of course it's going to have to be in mathlib. There's also some shenannigans involving casts from UInt32 to Nat or BitVec or Fin which I remember seeing something about in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"270676\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4\">#lean4</a> but this is all proofs so looks pretty harmless to me.</p>\n<p>The thing which surprised me the most is what looks like a bunch of fundamental theorems about <code>Prod.map</code> being deleted. It's inconceivable to me that these are not used elsewhere, so I assume what's happening is that they've been upstreamed somewhere, given that the branch compiles. </p>\n<p>A change that I don't understand is that the versions of Qq and importGraph in lakefile.lean have changed from master to nightly-testing but assuming that this is normal, I have now taken a look at this PR and confirm that you didn't add any weird code which deletes everyone's files and thus would be happy to merge or delegate assuming that there's nothing I'm saying above which wasn't supposed to be in the PR. </p>\n<p>You want me to merge it, delegate it, or what? I'm going to go to bed soon so might not be able to do anything for 10 hours or so. But I'm happy with the PR.</p>",
