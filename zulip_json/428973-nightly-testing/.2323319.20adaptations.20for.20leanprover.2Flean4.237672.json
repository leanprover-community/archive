Mostly the consequences in Mathlib are positive: we get to remove many <code>_</code>s!</p>\n<p>However at times we now need named arguments.</p>\n<p>In cases where we are writing \"uphill\" by a lemma, I don't so much mind the extra notation of named arguments.</p>\n<p>However if reviewers see things here where they would prefer to just have an explicit argument, please let me know. Even if <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7672\">leanprover/lean4#7672</a> is already in I'm happy to revert some of the changes.</p>",
