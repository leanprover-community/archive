It seems that there PR release action checks that the current nightly-with-mathlib release has such a tag in batteries and in mathlib before proceeding to create an adaption branch. This adds friction if mathlib builds (and nightly-with-mathlib advances) but batteries failed (e.g. in tests).</p>\n<p>Again, not super important, I was mostly just ranting in the moment.</p>",
