This results in many fewer <code>_</code>s in places, but also some places where we now need to use a named argument. In some, but not all, cases, I reverted such arguments back to explicit. Generally, if it appeared that the usage was rewriting from right to left in an \"unexpected\" way, I decided that having to use a named argument was okay, and the argument could stay implicit.</p>\n<p>However I'm very happy to make further changes, and if anyone wants to mention or list lemmas here that they'd like to have restored to their original explicitness, I'm happy to review and make that happen.</p>",
