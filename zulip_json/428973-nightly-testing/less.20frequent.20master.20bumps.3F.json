I didn't know it's already time based, so maybe I was just unlucky. Every 3h is also reasonable, so if others prefer that then no worries</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hmm, it just happend again that a <code>master</code> bump preempted the attempts to get nightly-testing going again. My proposal would be to bump<code>master</code> into nightly-testing only once per day, maybe 12h  after the toolchain bump, to reduce that from happening. (Usually I assume nightly-testing breaks due to toolchain bumps and rarely due to master bumps, so not much lost doing the latter less often?)</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/jkbkN5kTnQ2raZuKQLk6VaCX/bump.png\">bump.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/jkbkN5kTnQ2raZuKQLk6VaCX/bump.png\" title=\"bump.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"685x309\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/jkbkN5kTnQ2raZuKQLk6VaCX/bump.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
