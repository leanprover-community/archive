Would you mind taking a quick look at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/commit/e279b931a6f354a7ccb90b2f673dc432a4888c53\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/commit/e279b931a6f354a7ccb90b2f673dc432a4888c53</a>, and let me know whether you think this is acceptable.</p>\n<p>I'm a guessing this is due to the slight weakening of unification after Kyle fixed the nasty bug in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/6024\">lean#6024</a> (which, sadly, despite being wrong, was actually helping with unification problems).</p>\n<p>We are hoping to \"power up\" unification again to compensate, but it won't be able to happen immediately.</p>\n<p>So the question here is really -- is this an acceptable regression in Mathlib, and if not, can we do redesign in Mathlib right now to deal with it?</p>",
