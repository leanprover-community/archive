I think the first step is making <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Convex#doc\">docs#Convex</a> irreducible: right now we rely on the exact definition a lot, which we have to avoid before even attempting a refactor.</p>\n<p>Note that I'm not claiming that it should be irreducible forever: once more and more of the library uses <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=ConvexSpace.convexCombination#doc\">docs#ConvexSpace.convexCombination</a> (should we shorten it?) it might be useful to allow unfolding the definition, but for the sake of the refactor I think irreducibility will help a lot.</p>",
