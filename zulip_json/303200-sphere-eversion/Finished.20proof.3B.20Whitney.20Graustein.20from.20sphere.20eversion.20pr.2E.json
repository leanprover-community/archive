It currently uses only three extra axioms about turning number, which I plan to reduce to topology based axioms on winding numbers. I have done this under the supervision of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"112680\">@Johan Commelin</span> and Álvaro del pino Gomez. The code can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/MetalCreator666/WhitneyGraustein\">https://github.com/MetalCreator666/WhitneyGraustein</a></p>",
