However, with some projects like LTE, the <code>ToMathlib</code> directory consisted of many experiments containing material which we all knew was a good fit for mathlib but which sometimes we weren't happy with. A great example is homological algebra, where there are several subtleties getting the ideas into dependent type theory (a cohomology group is both a limit and a colimit, and our initial formalisation did not reflect this well enough); it took over a year, a major refactor, and the heroic efforts of Joël Riou to get this stuff into mathlib [ad: he's talking about his work in about 80 minutes at Lean Together!]</p>\n<p>However if there are parts of the formalisation in ToMathlib which you are pretty convinced are in final form, then I would strongly encourage people to PR them to mathlib sooner rather than later, because as we all know mathlib is extremely active, and the longer things are left the harder the job becomes. For example <code>simp</code> changed recently and a bunch of stuff broke; other major changes will I'm sure be coming in the future. Code breaking in your project means that you have to fix it; code which has made it into mathlib is the problem of the people making the changes to mathlib (and they are often in a very good position to fix the problems which show up because they understand the changes).</p>",
