I usually just write my new line as a comment, so the current goal state doesn't change.  However, I am wondering if there is a better way pause the LSP from updating the goal window.  Is this possible?  Thanks!</p>",

I think it could help to edit code earlier in a file and see what effect it has on a proof state at a point or a command's output later in the file. (I vaguely remember that there might have been a feature in the Emacs mode for Lean 3 allowing one of the messages in the info buffer to be pinned to the top, i.e., the second of these features.)</p>",
