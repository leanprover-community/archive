You can find more details on Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode/milestones\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode/milestones</a></p>\n<p>The first milestone will focus on repairing the library headers, Github workflows and documentation.</p>\n<p>The second milestone will do some basic internal cleanup of the Elisp code. \"Internal\" in the sense that these changes should be perceivable for most end-users.</p>\n<p>The third milestone comes with breaking changes. It aims to remove the hard dependency on lsp-mode. Ideally, end-users would be allowed to choose between lsp-mode and Eglot. Let's see how that goes. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"354934\">@David Thrane Christiansen</span>  had mentioned some problems with Eglot. In particular, we will have to see if we port the Lean4 Info View to Eglot or if we use the less feature-rich ElDoc when the end-user chooses Eglot instead of lsp-mode. As you can see, this milestone is not yet completely planned and we can discuss many things. Maybe we'll even split it into two milestones instead. Let's see how it goes.</p>",

Several upcoming changes to Lean4-Mode will be breaking changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefix all symbols and files with lean4-mode-.</li>\n<li>A deep refactor of all files and in particular, get rid of lean4-settings.el file and the lean4-keybinding-* user options.</li>\n<li>Support both Eglot and lsp-mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breaking changes are cumbersome for users. Should we merge all these changes onto a \"dev\" branch and release them all together in a single breaking release?</p>",
