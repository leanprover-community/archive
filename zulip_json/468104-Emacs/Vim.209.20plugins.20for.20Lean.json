A separate \"editor sidekick\" program like <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/lean-tui\">Lean-TUI</a> provides Lean specific UI features.</p>\n<p>Although I've written documentation and a plugin specifically for Vim 9, this \"editor sidekick\" approach works with <em>any</em> editor that supports LSP. For example, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"928352\">@Willem vanhulle</span>,  the author of Lean-TUI, uses the editor <a href=\"https://helix-editor.com/\">Helix</a>.</p>",
