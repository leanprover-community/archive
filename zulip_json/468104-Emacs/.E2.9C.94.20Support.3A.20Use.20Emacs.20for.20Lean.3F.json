To enable the feature, set <code>lean4-info-plain</code> to <code>nil</code> (or use <code>customize-variable</code>). When you move point in the <code>*Lean Goals*</code> infoview buffer inside a subexpression that has type information, the subexpression gets highlighted and the type information is displayed in the <code>*eldoc*</code> buffer (in the echo area, or in that buffer's own window if it has one).</p>",
