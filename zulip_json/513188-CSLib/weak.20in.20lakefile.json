I identified such a case and opened and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/cslib/pull/113\">cslib#113</a>. The alternative is to remove the weak from our options, which would enforce that all files must import <code>Mathlib.Init</code> for linters (transitively or directly). The tradeoffs here seem to be removing the chance of accidental non-linting in exchange for a dependency.</p>",

If this imports <code>Mathlib.Init</code>, it seems reasonable to drop the <code>weak</code> and require importing this.</p>",
