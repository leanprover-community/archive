The work I am doing involves property-based model checking of finite state automata, which is highly relevant to hardware model checking. I have formalised the work of \"Verification of concurrent programs: the automata-theoretic framework\" by  Moshe Y. Vardi in Lean4. I'm a bit unclear about the scope of CSLib, but I think that people involved in hardware model-checking would be very interested in this formalisation and work.

        "content": "<p>Hi Atticus, we would absolutely love for you to add a formalization of omega-automata (including tree automata). It seems to me that model-checking based on omega-automata might be a bit too specialized and be better done as a separate project that references the omega-automata definitions from CSlib. But this is just my personal opinion.</p>",
