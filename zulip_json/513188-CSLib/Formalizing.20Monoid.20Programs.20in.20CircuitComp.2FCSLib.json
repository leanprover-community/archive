        "content": "<p>This would be very appropriate and I would appreciate it. :) My repo has a definition of monoid programs (I called them <code>BarringtonProgram</code>, which is another name I've seen in the literature), and I have the conversion from a <code>BarringtonProgram</code> to <code>LayeredBranchingProgram</code> as it works for symmetric groups (which gives a smaller width than the obvious construction for other monoids).</p>\n<p>The statement you wrote is slightly stronger, because you allow different (I assume) accepting sets <code>F</code>. So this would be a good stronger thing to have. </p>\n<p>The other direction (forward of your implication), that a bounded-width branching program can be converted back to a monoid program, could go \"directly\" or via the NC0 compilation, which is something I've been looking at doing a bit. I think it would be good.</p>",

So for any monoid you can have its own action on itself, for a branching program of width |M|. For the symmetric group S_n, it acts on Fin n, so you get a branching program of width n.</p>",
