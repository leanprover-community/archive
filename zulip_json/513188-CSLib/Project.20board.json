Would it not be a good idea to use the project dashboard approach from the equational theories project to post reasonably proximate tasks that newcomers can pick up?</p>",

I'm looking into what possibilities there are for maintaining a public overview/roadmap, but haven't really settled on anything yet, so discussing this is very valuable.
