It is a systematisation and strict generalisation of what TimeM does and would definitely qualify as “lightweight”. It just allows explicit specification what is being counted upfront, allows defining reductions between models, custom cost models, and allows lower bound proofs, and also surprisingly to me circuit complexity upper bounds. Keeping it lightweight is why Tanner suggested to put my combinator proposal into a Free monad.</p>",
