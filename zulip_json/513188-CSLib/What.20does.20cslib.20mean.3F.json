I discovered cslib on LinkedIn, but I didn't really understand what cslib actually is. Here are some questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What I understand is that it will be a library that will formalize computer science subjects for lean, with the goal of being able to do formal verification, right?</li>\n<li>Will it be an official library, with a repository and documentation like MathLib?</li>\n<li>And the most important question, what is this Boolean language? It already exists or will be developed, why do you need it?</li>\n</ul>",
