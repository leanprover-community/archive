Concretely  if a user starts a new project with <code>lake new &lt;ProjectName&gt;  cs</code> or <code>lake new &lt;ProjectName&gt;  compsci</code>, lake should set up a new project with the correct cslib toolchain as the toplevel dependency. Then it should fetch mathlib's cache (not sure how this should work until <code>lake cache</code> is ready, but maybe an alias lake executable?)</p>",
