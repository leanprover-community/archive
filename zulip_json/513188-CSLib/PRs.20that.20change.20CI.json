We can add this back later in a weekly test like Mathlib does, but this currently gives a -47.3% reduction in build instructions that will make both local development and CI much faster. (And make <code>nightly-testing</code> easier for me to maintain) </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/cslib/pull/189\">cslib#189</a> I just opened to check for problematic <code>grind</code> annotations. It identified several that I for the time being have added as testing exceptions that we should follow up on in later PRs.</li>\n</ul>",
