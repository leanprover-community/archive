A lot of things you get from big O notation of course, but there's also a lot missing - I mean, \"poly\" isn't even a big O class itself. And it 'should' be a one-liner that if f is in poly and g is in log, then f(x+5) * g(x) is also in poly. And stuff like that</p>\n<p>And then there's lots of connecting this back and forth to things about reals. Like you should have that <code>Real.log</code>, <code>Real.logb</code>, <code>Nat.log</code>, <code>Nat.log2</code> are all in log to start with. Similar things with Real.sqrt vs. Nat.sqrt, Real.exp vs real powers vs natural number powers, all that jazz</p>",
