Commit streams (and other similar streams, e.g. <a class=\"message-link\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Technical.20Debt.20Counters/near/540705788\">#mathlib4 &gt; Technical Debt Counters @ 💬</a>) occasionally contain short discussions relevant to the project that people might otherwise miss.</p>\n<p>Additionally, people see only the streams for the projects they're interested in by default, compared to now, where you subscribe to <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"116290\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/116290-rss\">#rss</a> and get a firehose of streams for all kinds of projects on the zulip.</p>\n<p>A disadvantage is that it makes the project channel more spammy for people interested in the project but not the commit stream. Those people can of course mute the stream. Should it turn out that most people interested in a project are not interested in the corresponding stream, the stream can of course be moved to <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"116290\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/116290-rss\">#rss</a>.</p>",
