I didn't realize I could specify the batteries lint driver like that, thanks for the info! It is also nice that <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Batteries.Tactic.Lint.getChecks#doc\">docs#Batteries.Tactic.Lint.getChecks</a> is designed in a way that it picks up the Cslib environment linter I wrote for namespace usage.</p>\n<p>I had left off the docs linters at the time because I wanted to get the testing in place early, but agree we should go ahead and fix these. I opened <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/cslib/pull/181\">cslib#181</a> for this, can respective file authors please add documentation where the failures in CI indicate? Thanks!</p>",
