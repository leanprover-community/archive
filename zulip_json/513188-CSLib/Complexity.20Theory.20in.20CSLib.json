(In particular, to validate that there's nothing wrong with the definitions).</li>\n<li>Based on the name, I feel like I would be more likely to expect CSLib to have these concepts than Mathlib or formal-conjectures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, does this seem like the sort of thing that would make sense to put in CSLib? I know there is a plan for CSLib to have its own language, so perhaps a Turing-machine based formulation of complexity classes doesn't belong for that reason, but I'd be interested in the opinion of anyone who's more actively involved.</p>",
