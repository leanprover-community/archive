However, the PR is rather long and ugly due to the translation between the uniformity and neighbourhoods of a point. Before I put any effort into golfing the current proof, I thought it was worth asking if I am barking up the wrong tree and there is some other approach I should be taking to the proof? (I have a passing awareness of uniformities and filters, but I don't have much experience working with them.)</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Christopher</p>",
