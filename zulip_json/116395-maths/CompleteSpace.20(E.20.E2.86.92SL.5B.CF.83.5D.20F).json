I'm also removing the unneeded <code>T2Space</code> assumption for <code>ContinuousMultilinearMap</code>s and <code>ContinuousAlternatingMap</code>s.<br>\nThe theorems still require that the topology on the domain is generated by its restrictions to von Neumann bounded sets (+ an instance for the case of a <code>SequentialSpace</code>). Is there a counterexample for some very bad domain TVS?</p>",
