It's complete and sorry-free.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/JustinMcClung/formal-distribution\">https://github.com/JustinMcClung/formal-distribution</a></p>\n<p>About 3,850 lines across 11 files. Covers formal distributions, expansion operators, formal delta (all properties from Prop 1.3.5), decomposition theorem, locality with j-th products, and Fourier transform / lambda-brackets.</p>\n<p>Design choices worth noting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two structure types (<code>FormalDistribution</code> / <code>GeneralizedFormalDistribution</code>) for finite vs bounded-finite support so delta lives in the right type without axioms.</li>\n<li>Locality, delta, decomposition, j-th products all parameterized over arbitrary variable pairs (i, j) in n-variable distributions. Standard 2-variable API recovered via <code>abbrev</code> aliases.</li>\n<li><code>HahnSeries</code> bridge gives a <code>CommRing</code> instance for 1D distributions via <code>Function.Injective.commRing</code>, connecting to <code>Mathlib.Algebra.Vertex.VertexOperator</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm continuing to formalize the next chapters and have two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there pieces worth upstreaming into Mathlib? Happy to prepare PRs starting small.</li>\n<li>Anything in the design that would create friction with the existing vertex algebra development? I'd rather fix it now than after another 4,000 lines.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
