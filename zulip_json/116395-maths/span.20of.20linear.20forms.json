I assume that for any <code>z != 0</code>, there exists <code>i : I</code> such that <code>f(i)(z) != 0</code>. I want to prove that I can find a basis of <code>E*</code> of the form <code>(f(i_1), ..., f(i_n))</code>.</p>\n<p>The idea I had in mind was to prove that the family <code>f</code> spans <code>E*</code>,  and then extract a basis from it. To do so, I wanted to use the following result: a linear form is in the span of a certain family of linear forms if and only if its kernel contains the intersection of the kernels of this family. Is this result in Mathlib? (or something alike?) I also wanted to ask if you had a better idea on how to prove this result (irl and in Lean). Thanks!</p>",
