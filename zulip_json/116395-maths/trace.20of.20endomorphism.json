The analysts know about trace class operators on Banach spaces but this involves convergence. However there's a purely algebraic concept for vector spaces over a field (and free modules over a ring and almost certainly for more general modules over a ring but I don't know how general it goes); if an endomorphism of a vector space has finite-dimensional image then there's a well-behaved concept of trace, which you can just compute by looking at the restriction of the endomorphism to the image (or more generally any finite-dimensional space containing the image) and taking the usual trace.</p>",
