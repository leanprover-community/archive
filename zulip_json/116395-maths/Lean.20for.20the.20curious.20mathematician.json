I've finally got the organisational hiccups worked out. So, if you are a mathematician, or you know a mathematician who is really interested in learning more about Lean, please let them know about this meeting: <a href=\"https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/\">https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/</a></p>\n<p>The plan is to have a couple of talks and tutorial sessions, but to also have ~50% of the time dedicated to hackathons and brainstorming sessions, or pair programming. Novices could team up with experts, to see how they go about setting up a theory, etc...</p>\n<p>There is limited funding for PhD students and postdocs. Please let me know if you need this.<br>\nIn general, if you have any questions, please ask.</p>\n<p>ping: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110050\">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G.
