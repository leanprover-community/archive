        "content": "<p>One hint: don't resolve topics (ever, even when they're resolved).</p>\n<p>Yeah so in Lean if you write <code>a &lt;= b</code> then for this to make sense a and b have to have the same \"Type\", i.e. they have to \"be the same kind of thing\". In your example you seem to be claiming that a set of reals is &lt;= a real number, and these have different types, so Lean is complaining that one it read last (the real number) doesn't have the type it expected.</p>\n<p>So what actually do you mean by the question? I don't know this area at all but I do understand why Lean doesn't understand what you're writing,</p>",
