Getting rid of the <code>norm_cast</code> attribute on <code>int.coe_nat_succ</code> fixes this problem, and <code>push_cast</code> gives me <code>(2 : int)</code>. I can see there's been some attempt to fix it by setting a lower priority to the <code>norm_cast</code> attribute on <code>int.coe_nat_succ</code>, but this fix is obviously not working any more. One fix I found, was to get rid of the <code>norm_cast</code> attribute on <code>int.coe_nat_succ</code> and put the attribute on <code>nat.succ_eq_add_one</code>, but this seems like it might be evil.</p>",
