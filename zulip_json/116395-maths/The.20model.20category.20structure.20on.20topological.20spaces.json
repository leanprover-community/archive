In order to construct model categories, there is a general theorem by J. Smith which relies on notions of locally presentable categories and the solution set condition, but as far as I remember, even though I already have most of the ingredients in order to formalize a version of the theorem, it would require more work on accessible functors/categories in order to be able to use it (e.g. the WIP PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20267\">#20267</a>, which is about the accessibility of comma categories).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry to revive this older thread, but I’d like to get a sense of where things stand before diving in.</p>\n<p>I’m interested in a formalization of Hovey’s <em>Model Category Structures on Chain Complexes of Sheaves</em> (arXiv:math/9909024) as a stepping stone toward formalizing some of my own work on derived categories of noncommutative projective schemes. The main technical ingredient there is Hovey's recognition theorem for cofibrantly generated model categories (Theorem 2.1.19 from <em>Model Categories</em>), which yields the injective model structure on chain complexes in a Grothendieck category.</p>\n<p>Before I start working on this, I wanted to check if there has been any progress on formalizing the recognition theorem (if anyone is working along that direction) or the surrounding machinery. I’d like to avoid duplicating effort, especially since earlier comments suggested that related work may already be ongoing.</p>",

Proposition 3.13 in this paper is the construction of the injective model category on unbounded complexes in a Grothendieck abelian category. Whether in Hovey's paper or via this approach, there must be some technicalities in order to prove that the assumptions of the recognition theorem hold...

        "content": "<p>In both approaches in Beke's or Hovey's articles, there is a use of the Gabriel-Popescu theorem (already in mathlib) to say that the Grothendieck abelian category <code>C</code> that is considered is a localization (in a certain sense) of the category of modules over a ring <code>R</code>. Both argue using a result from the book by Bo Stenström, <em>Rings and Modules of Quotients</em>: the category <code>C</code> identifies to a \"Giraud subcategory\" of <code>ModuleCat R</code>, and theorem 10.2 p. 48 of this book classifies these Giraud subcategories in terms of \"topologies\" of <code>R</code>, which are families of ideals <code>I</code> in <code>R</code> satisfying certain properties. Then, <code>C</code> shall be the localization with respect to the inclusions <code>I ⟶ R</code>.<br>\nFrom this, Hovey deduces that all the objects in <code>C</code> satisfy a certain smallness property relatively to a cardinal, a condition which is (strictly?) weaker than the property satisfied by presentable objects (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CategoryTheory.IsCardinalPresentable#doc\">docs#CategoryTheory.IsCardinalPresentable</a>).
