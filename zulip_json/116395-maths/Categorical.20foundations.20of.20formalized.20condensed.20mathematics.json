E. Nuccio</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243562\">@Adam Topaz</span>, and myself, have written the paper <em>Categorical foundations of formalized condensed mathematics</em> about the process of establishing the category-theoretic framework necessary to do condensed mathematics in mathlib.</p>\n<p>We prove some general results about sheaves on extensive, (pre)regular and (pre)coherent categories, recovering key results in the foundations of condensed mathematics. In many cases, these results were known, but not proved explicitly in the \"correct generality\". We provide these proofs in the informal text, along with links to the lean code which is already in mathlib. </p>\n<p>The preprint can be found at <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-04633614v1\">https://hal.science/hal-04633614v1</a>. Comments very welcome!</p>",
