I have come across a situation where I want to prove that a ring S is noetherian and I know that another ring R is isomorphic to S and that R is noetherian. So I tried to use the theorem 'is_noetherian_ring_of_ring_equiv' from the lean file <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/195fcd60ff2bfe392543bceb0ec2adcdb472db4c/src/ring_theory/noetherian.lean#L532\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/195fcd60ff2bfe392543bceb0ec2adcdb472db4c/src/ring_theory/noetherian.lean#L532</a>. <br>\nHowever I am getting an error which I don't understand. I think it's a type level universe issue. What I have provided is of type u but the expected argument is type  max u ? but the ? in my argument is of type u so I am confused. I tried asking in the algebraic geometry forum but it's taking some time to get a reply so I thought I would try my luck here. MWE included below.
