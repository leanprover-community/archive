I don't have too much experience with these things, but I have only ever seen fibered categories being used to talk about stacks, and then one only needs categories fibered in groupoids anyways. If anyone has more experience with these things, it would be great to hear your opinion.</p>\n<p>For example, in these notes: <a href=\"http://url\">https://sites.math.washington.edu/~jarod/moduli.pdf</a> they never introduces fibered categories, and instead only works with categories fibered in groupoids (which are called prestacks there).</p>",

So the point is that often there is a natural choice of fiber categories, e.g. for the fibered category of modules over the category of rings we would like the fiber over a ring <code>R</code> to be the category <code>Mod R</code>.</p>\n<p>So far I have defined functors between different fibered categories <code>p, q</code> with <code>p.HasFibers</code> and <code>q.HasFibers</code> as a normal functor of fibered categories + functors between all the fiber categories <code>p.Fib S</code> and <code>q.Fib S</code> such that these are compatible with the functor on underlying fibered categories. Now this works decently, and I've managed to show that a functor is full resp. faithful iff all the functors between the fiber categories are. I've almost showed that this is true for equivalences of fibered categories as well. </p>\n<p>The problem is that I feel its a bit annoying to have to define the functors on the fibers, as these are completely determined by the underlying functor on the fibered category anyways. Another alternative would be to define functors between <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> to be a functor of fibered categories + the condition that any element in the image of some <code>p.Fib s</code> gets mapped to something in the image of <code>q.Fib s</code>. From this one could reconstruct the functors on the fibers. This feels more convenient to verify when defining the functors, but I guess then the problem would be that the functor on the fiber categories would be quite inexplicit.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any ideas one what would be a good approach here? I think my problem is that I don't have enough experience with lean to tell if what I'm doing is unnecessarily complicated or not.</p>",

Faithfully flat is equivalent to flat and flat-locally surjective. Do we have proofs of these?</li>\n</ul>",
