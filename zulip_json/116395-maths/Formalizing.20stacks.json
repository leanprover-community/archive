I don't have too much experience with these things, but I have only ever seen fibered categories being used to talk about stacks, and then one only needs categories fibered in groupoids anyways. If anyone has more experience with these things, it would be great to hear your opinion.</p>\n<p>For example, in these notes: <a href=\"http://url\">https://sites.math.washington.edu/~jarod/moduli.pdf</a> they never introduces fibered categories, and instead only works with categories fibered in groupoids (which are called prestacks there).</p>",
