I have been thinking recently about total (left/right) derived functors, so that stating what a Quillen adjunction is should not be very hard. However, proving that there is a Quillen equivalence requires that we already know both categories are model categories... I am afraid the hardest parts should be more about constructing these model category structures rather than about getting an equivalence. I would suggest starting with topological spaces (or compactly generated hausdorff spaces?).</p>",
