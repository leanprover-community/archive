It's so happy to see people want to contribute to this project. Now it's not provable yet, but we just need one more step to prove it. I did update something on parallelism but I forget to push to github. I just pushed them now and you can have a look. Parallelism is simply defined by two lines without intersections. I am now proving corresponding angles for parallel lines are equal. It's a result by contradiction and that exterior angles are larger than the interior.

From this, one can derive Hilbert's geometry and the proofs that the two are equivalent. It should not be too difficult based on the existing formalizations that will tell you about all the details and help in case one is stuck on a proof. I guess it is not difficult to port  the proofs from Coq to Lean, the first step would be to write the tactics, you need some tactics to deal with pseudo-transitivity of collinearity and symmetries of geometric predicates, etc (see <a href=\"https://adg2023.matf.bg.ac.rs/downloads/slides/IntroductionBoutryNarboux.pdf\">https://adg2023.matf.bg.ac.rs/downloads/slides/IntroductionBoutryNarboux.pdf</a> for a list of tactics). Then each lemma can be reproduced one by one.  A difficulty could be that in some chapters at the end, we rely on a tactic based on Gröbner's basis (nsatz in Coq), I don't know if there is an equivalent in Lean4. The proof could be done manually but that would be boring. <br>\nAnother difficulty is cleaning up: detecting duplicates,  giving good names etc.<br>\nSometimes it may well be the case that a long proof can be replaced by a much a simpler one. <br>\nRoland Coghetto ported GeoCoq to Isabelle using Sledgehammer, without trying to understand the proofs, I don't know if there is a hammer for Isabelle, that could be an option. The hammer could help also detecting duplicates, and shorter proofs.<br>\nMaybe the porting of GeoCoq could be a good opportunity to translate proof from tactic style to a more declarative style, maybe based on tactics like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> 's Lean-Verbose. </p>\n<p>Yoan Geran has exported our formalization of Euclid/Book 1 (238 lemmas, 20klocs,15% of<br>\nGeoCoq) to Dedukti, and he can translate the proofs back to Coq, HOL-Light, Lean, Matita, PVS and Open Theory. <br>\nBut the (compressed) size of the translated proofs are multiplied by 10 (Lean, Matita, Coq), 25 (Hol-Light) and 50 (PVS).<br>\nSo it may not be usable in practice, even if there is room for improvements.<br>\nThe difficulty is that Dedukti works with lambda terms, and it would be hard to get back some tactics that make the proofs shorter.<br>\nFor example, in GeoCoq we have a tactic that derive automatically a lot of ndg conditions, for example if A is different from B, then the midpoint of AB is different from A and from B, etc... it applies several rules like that in a forward chaining manner and it completes the context with many NDGs. Maybe some of these NDGs are not actually used in the proof, but it is convenient to have them for automation. If one translates the proofs from the lambda term, one can detect that some part are derived but not used (dead code). So the translation in some sense simplifies the proofs, but in practice because all theses facts are produced by a single call to a tactic, the \" simplified \" proof is much longer than the original.</p>",
