The docstring gives an explanation for the reason (i.e., we want the volume measure in hyperbolic space to be doubling), but this stands in contrast to the standard literature. I can understand the desire to encompass as many things as possilbe with a single type class, but are we sure this isn't a bad idea? That is, do the standard results like Assouad's snowflaking embedding theorem obviously (or even non-obviously) still hold?</p>",
