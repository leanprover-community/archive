        "content": "<p>I've worked with high school kids in the UK and the main problem is that proof assistants like lean are focused on rigorous proofs of theorems, but the UK syllabus before university is mostly focused on calculations, so students have not really got much experience in what lean is good at. The natural number game works with schoolkids but right now the other obvious target, namely Euclidean geometry, is still rather difficult to do in lean, especially with no pictures</p>",
