For abelian varieties, we say <code>polarization</code> for an isogeny to the dual, but I think I have seen that word used for other, possibly similar notions in functional analysis.  The reason I am asking is that in SGA3 Exp XXI section 1.2 Demazure introduces such a map from weight space to its dual, and calls it <code>p</code>, which is not really an acceptable name for mathlib.</p>",
