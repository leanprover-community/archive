The \"unramified\" part would correspond it them having no external legs. i.e. being a pure \"partition function\" in the physics sense of the word. (a vacuum amplitude).</p>\n<p>Witten, a few years back now (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04293\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04293</a>) suggested the full Geometric Langlands could be explained by the conjectured S-Duality of N=4 Super Yang Mills. Where S-Duality is generalisation of the duality between electric charges and magnetic monopoles, specifically where the coupling constant goes from g-&gt;1/g. The Riemann surfaces appear again by compactifying two dimensions.</p>\n<p>Now, here's the thing: Physicists have at the moment become a bit \"stuck\" with trying to formulate a non-perturbative formulation of string theory or M-Theory. By which I mean a formulation which doesn't rely on an asymptotic series expansion. (There is the AdS/CFT correspondence but since our universe is dS not AdS this is only partly helpful).</p>\n<p>So my view is that in fact the path to M-Theory, may come from solving the full geometric Langlands conjecture. Such a proof may point the way to the existence and construction of the full non-perturbative M-Theory. (In a similar way the the proof of the Moonshine conjecture pointed to the existence of the Monster CFT).</p>\n<p>So in that sense a formalisation of the geometric Langlands could be a path to solving the ultimate questions in physics. </p>\n<p>It may involve formalising path integrals which is notoriously hard to do. Although in certain cases they can be shown to give finite answers such as topological quantum field theory on a sphere or torus. (The result often being a modular form in terms of the parameters. The duality of g-&gt;1/g appearing as the symmetry of the modular form).</p>\n<p>What do you think? Anyone who works in this area have any thoughts on the matter?</p>",
