In Mathlib we have <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CompactSpace#doc\">docs#CompactSpace</a> for stating that a space is compact (independently of anything), and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=IsCompact#doc\">docs#IsCompact</a> for compact subsets of a topological space. But none of them really allow to state theorem 2.33 as is, because <code>K</code> cannot have both type <code>Set X</code> and <code>Set Y</code>.</p>",
