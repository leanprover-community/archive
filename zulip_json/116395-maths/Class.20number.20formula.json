Jason and I are wondering whether we could golf your proof that it has null frontier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you want a textbook reference or some Lean code?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want some Lean code, you can have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12268\">#12268</a>. It is a bit outdated but the definitions are still good. The set in question is the set of elements in the <code>fundamentalCone</code> of norm ≤ 1. That is:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">normLessThanOne</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Set</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mixedSpace</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">K</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∈</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">fundamentalCone</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">K</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∧</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">mixedEmbedding.norm</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">≤</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
