There has been <a href=\"#narrow/channel/113488-general/topic/Challenging.20proofs/near/269117577\">previous but unresolved discussion</a>, which seems worth continuing. Based on that discussion, it seems like a tiling should exist in a topological space, with its associated symmetry group being a subgroup of the automorphisms of that space. Beyond this, however, it’s not clear how other aspects of the definition should be formulated. Given that, there are several foundational questions that merit discussion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should we have separate definitions for discrete and continuous tilings?</li>\n<li>Can/should we use the same definition for finite and infinite tilings? (I believe the answer is yes for both)</li>\n<li>How should a tile be defined?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are additional considerations such as defining protosets, decorations, matching rules, equivalence relations, etc. but these seem downstream of the core definitional choices above. Joseph Meyers has made suggestions answering these questions by <a href=\"#narrow/channel/113488-general/topic/Challenging.20proofs/near/269170044\">offering a formalization outline</a>.

(33 PRs of dependencies elsewhere in mathlib - more basic material about group actions, quotients etc. rather than specifically about tilings - have already gone in.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should I start PRing that material without waiting until I've built anything more substantial on top of it?</li>\n<li>Is the design of defining things in the discrete case first, with a view to setting up parallel but separate API for the continuous case after discrete material has started going into mathlib, appropriate? (If continuous material is set up in the very general case of a topological space with a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=ContinuousConstSMul#doc\">docs#ContinuousConstSMul</a> action rather than a metric context with a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=IsIsometricSMul#doc\">docs#IsIsometricSMul</a> action, then some of the most basic discrete API probably corresponds to the continuous API with the discrete topology. But I think needing to deal with an irrelevant topology all the time would be a pain when working with discrete tilings. The interesting case of relating continuous and discrete tilings isn't the one with the discrete topology, it's the one of genuinely continuous tilings where all the tiles can be expressed as unions of the tiles from some underlying tiling and so a translation to the discrete context done that way.)</li>\n<li>Is <code>Mathlib.Combinatorics.Tiling</code> an appropriate place for the discrete material? What about the continuous material?</li>\n<li>Is setting things up specifically with a multiplicative group action appropriate? I think that's a lot more natural than an additive group action for the typically noncommutative cases I'm concerned with, but does mean that anyone formalizing things about translational tilings of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{Z}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Z</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6644em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (Greenfeld-Tao etc.) would need to make a lot of use of <code>Multiplicative</code> (or else set up <code>to_additive</code> to duplicate the whole theory for additive tilings).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think AperiodicMonotilesLean already has answers for decorations, matching rules and similar, though it may not be very obvious at a glance. The fact that a protoset is an indexed family of tiles means that multiple prototiles that are otherwise identical can be distinguished; the fact that a prototile comes with a subgroup of its stabilizer corresponds to a tile possibly having asymmetrical markings. The <code>TileSetFunction</code> abstraction covers matching rules, because rather than using basic functions such as <code>IsTiling</code> you can use ones that mean \"is a tiling satisfying the matching rules\"; definitions such as \"aperiodic\" all take a <code>TileSetFunction</code> that says what the rules are for permitted tilings. (The intent is to have predicates on <code>TileSetFunction</code>s for things such as \"this is a local property, i.e. only depends on bounded patches of the tiling\".)</p>",

After the mono tile discovery my friend and I spent time trying to make a puzzle with solid 'monotile pieces'. Meaning each piece is the 3D solid where each 2D slice  was part of the infinite family, but got scooped by Oskar (1). Doing that involved writing software to simulate everything, and we were going to use a recreated patch from one of the original renders:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/bIQgXOfhy1dT7-Pk-KUbje2Q/patch.mov\">patch.mov</a></p>\n<p>During that effort I got completely sidetracked by the following observation: under certain constraints, when transitioning through the infinite family, all of the vertices follow circular arcs. I had the opportunity to speak with Chaim about this  a number of times and we could not get a handle on things. A lot of our unease was centered around how the underlying grid(s) are defined and determining which vertices of the tiling are fixed as a result. Here is the bottom left tile from that animation, isolated with its circular arcs overlaid. <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/0JRNe6sSiuIP60ggYm2rg-fy/uuid894269C6-34C5-430F-892E-7CEA1BCE9809code001library3type3mode1loctruecaptrue.mov\">uuid=894269C6-34C5-430F-892E-7CEA1BCE9809&amp;code=001&amp;library=3&amp;type=3&amp;mode=1&amp;loc=true&amp;cap=true.mov</a></p>\n<p>Now here is the relevant part: In addition to lying on circular arcs, all of the vertices travel around at the same angular velocity, w.r.t. their circle. This naturally leads you to making the variation where vertices complete a full revolution.

Some things might focus heavily on the combinatorial side (say if you wanted to formalize Berger's theorem that whether a set of Wang tiles admits a tiling is undecidable, possibly using one of the later presentations of the proof such as Robinson's). Some things might depend heavily on the geometrical and topological side (say if you wanted to formalize a proof that all topological discs that tile the plane using translated copies only can also do so with the tiles arranged in a lattice; Kenyon and others). Some things might heavily involve the computational side.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are many things in this space I'm looking to formalize. Beyond verification, my intent in formalizing is to strengthen my understanding. I 'learn by doing' and the hope is that formalizing tiling theory will help me understand both the established results I half-understand and things I have found like the one above. That being said, it really looks like we may not have a ‘one size fits all’ definition. </p>\n<p>One 'intermediate' result I was considering going after was the classification of frieze/wallpaper groups. After reading and thinking about it more, I'm now realizing the following: we theoretically could come up with some definition of tiling and use it in those classification theorems, but it isn't required. I bring this up because we are discussing 'how should we define tiling' and it has caused me to realize that something I thought was about tilings isn't. Is it fair to say that these theorems \"are really about the underlying symmetry groups of the space, and tiles are just a convenient way to think about them\"?</p>",

Some might just be ways to think about the underlying isometry group, most involve various combinatorial elements as well. The basic API I've set up so far in AperiodicMonotilesLean (reminder: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33523\">#33523</a> needs more review) is largely closely connected to group actions simply because the combinatorial aspects appear more as you move to more specific results rather than things about all tilings (or all periodic tilings, etc.), which I haven't got to yet.</p>",

Similarly, prove the n-dimensional crystallographic restriction theorem and deduce the 2-dimensional version, rather than just proving the 2-dimensional version.</p>",
