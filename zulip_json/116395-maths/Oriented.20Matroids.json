I need some research on how to define 'infinite' oriented matroids which is relatable with the current implementation of <code>Matroid</code>. However the most reliable definition of infinite oriented matroid I could find is as noted in 'Oriented Matroids' by Bjorner et al, which I don't think is relatable with B-matroids. If someone's interested, maybe we can talk about it in <a href=\"#narrow/channel/116395-maths/topic/Oriented.20Matroids/with/493060328\">this thread</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/MATHEMATIK/DMO/pubs/feu-dmo040-15.pdf\">This paper</a> probably contains the definitions you need.</p>\n<p>That said, I don’t think there is any issues with just making them finite (i.e. making the ambient type finite in the definition). I don’t regret allowing mathlib matroids to be infinite, but it has been a massive amount of work which has required fleshing out a lot of the theory myself (I’m in the process of writing a paper with a bunch of new stuff on infinite matroids that has directly come out of formalization). And that was with the help of a somewhat robust literature of infinite matroids already existing. </p>\n<p>To get something started on oriented matroids, I think finiteness is ok.</p>",

Also it should be much less work to first define an infinite structure then restrict it to finite case to prove several theorems and later generalizing to infinite case, than to define the finite structure, work on that, and later refactor every theorem.</p>",
