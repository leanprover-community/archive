I want to prove the statement <code>∃ N : ℕ, ∀ w : list α, w.length ≥ N → has_sublist_prop w</code> and wish to use the cardinality of <code>s</code> plus one to start, but I can't seem to understand why <code>use ((s.card)+1)</code> brings up an error message regarding <code>has_add</code>.  Furthermore, if I remove the plus one, then it still fails to use <code>s.card</code>.</p>",
