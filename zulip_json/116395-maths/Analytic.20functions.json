The space of formal series is the projective (?) limit of the spaces of <code>r</code>-jets. In each space associativity is trivial because it holds for functions representing these <code>r</code>-jets, and the <code>r</code>-jet of <code>f âˆ˜ g</code> is determined by <code>r</code>-jets of <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>.<br>\nIs there something wrong with this proof?</p>",
