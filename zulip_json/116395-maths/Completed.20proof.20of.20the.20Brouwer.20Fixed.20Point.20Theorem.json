See \"brouwer_fixed_point\" at <a href=\"https://github.com/Shamrock-Frost/BrouwerFixedPoint/blob/master/src/brouwer_fixed_point.lean\">https://github.com/Shamrock-Frost/BrouwerFixedPoint/blob/master/src/brouwer_fixed_point.lean</a>. This project involved formalizing a good amount of homological algebra, all of the eilenberg steenrod axioms, and some stuff about convex sets. I'll be working on merging this code into mathlib soon (after taking a break), but first I'd like to get the page at <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/100.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/100.html</a> updated :)</p>",
