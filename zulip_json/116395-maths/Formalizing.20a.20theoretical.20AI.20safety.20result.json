It is a fairly simple theorem, but was a fun exercise to formalize (and was useful in learning the differences between Lean 3 and Lean 4). And now we have the basic setting down in case we want to formalize follow-up results (this paper is just a baby step).</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/52p9sbiR-pfAFOWh1JUmGDuX/debate.png\">debate.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/52p9sbiR-pfAFOWh1JUmGDuX/debate.png\" title=\"debate.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/52p9sbiR-pfAFOWh1JUmGDuX/debate.png\"></a></div>",
