A consequence of this would be the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality\">Isoperimetric Inequality</a>, which is one of the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/100-missing.html\">still-missing theorems</a> in Wiedijk's 100-theorem list. Another motivation comes from formalizing the resolution of the moving sofa problem <a href=\"#narrow/channel/116395-maths/topic/Sofa.20problem.20may.20have.20been.20solved\">discussed here</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested in joining the effort?
