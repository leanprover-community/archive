One issue is that the convention is to take F-<strong>submodules</strong> of V of dimension k, but this cannot be generalised, and is only valid for fields with finite dimensional subspaces. So, in EGA, Grothendieck used instead the <strong>quotients</strong> of M that are locally free with rank k.</p>",
