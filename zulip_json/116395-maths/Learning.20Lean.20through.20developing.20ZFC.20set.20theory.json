The problem is that I developed ordered pairs using Kuratowski's definition, with the idea that the functions 'fst' and 'snd' on pairs are 'calculable' without using methods like \"Classical.choose\" of existential type. When I try to formulate a theorem of the type <br>\n<code>math\n           \\forall (w : U), isOrderedPair w \\iff w = \\&lt; (fst w) , (snd w)) \\&gt;\n    </code><br>\nWhich I call \"OrderedPair_is_WellConstructed,\" I have no way to do it. How can I get help?
