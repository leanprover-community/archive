        "content": "<p>I am afraid there is no \"obvious way\" here. If you define <code>M₁ ⊗ M₂</code> to be the sheafification of <code>M₁.val ⊗ M₂.val</code>, in order to proceed, you need to show that  <code>(M₁ ⊗ M₂) ⊗ M₃</code> is isomorphic to <code>(M₁.val ⊗ M₂.val) ⊗ M₃.val</code> (and something similar for <code>M₁ ⊗ (M₂ ⊗ M₃)</code>. In order to do this, the critical lemma that is needed is that if <code>f : M₁ ⟶ M₂</code> and <code>g : N₁ ⟶ N₂</code> are morphisms of presheaves which become an isomorphism after sheafification, then it is also the case of <code>f ⊗ g : M₁ ⊗ N₁ ⟶ M₂ ⊗ N₂</code>, which I have obtained in PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/19915\">#19915</a>.
