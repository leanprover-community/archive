It is of potential interest maybe somewhere in the realm of Lean tactic implementation: <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626823?fbclid=IwAR3NAo-vEfroXB3bJ5h8YyidpV0aVhMNCOVuu7pVM_RBNRuKb99utMDxY3Q\">Decidability of the satisfiability problem for Boolean set theory with the unordered Cartesian product operator</a>.</p>\n<p>In general this family of results on decidable sublanguages of set theory depends on algorithms with iterated exponential time complexity, so really only feasible on a conventional computer for a small number of variables.  If there were a quantum computer Lean you might be able to get a few more variables out of these, though saying how much more is pretty technical and may be disappointing, for example see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0290\">Quantum 3-SAT is QMA1-complete</a>.</p>",
