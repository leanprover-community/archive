I'd personally be thrilled to see the proof formalized.</li>\n<li>My main priority now is to have the proof reviewed by human experts, the most common way for academics as of now. As I will mostly be busy with this, I cannot commit too much time on formalization myself.</li>\n<li>The tools are elementary, but the proof is very long and will consume a lot of human-hours. I would encourage one to judge the opportunity cost of spending time on this vs. doing other things.</li>\n<li>On top of that, right now it is not the case that a formalization is _necessary_ like Kepler's conjecture. The proof, while long, should be readable by a human given sufficient time. Of course a full formalization will improve the credibility, but right now  I have no good estimate of the additional gain from full formalization (would be happy to hear any thoughts on this).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please do not misunderstand this as discouraging the formalization. I would love to see it formalized! It's just that I cannot lead the formalization effort as of now, and right now myself cannot guarantee what would be the benefit esp. given the potential work-hours needed.</p>",
