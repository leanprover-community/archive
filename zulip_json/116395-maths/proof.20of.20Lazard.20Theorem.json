There are several proofs mentioned in the link above (and also a proof in the Hazewinkel 's book <em>Formal Group Laws and Applications</em>). I was wondering which proof I should follow or which proof is better to formalize. We can assume that we have enough APIs for formal group law, including functional equation lemma in Hazewinkel's book. </p>\n<p>Assuming this result, we are able to say that the functor <code>FGL : CommRingCat ⥤ Type</code> is corepresented by some formal group law <code>F</code> over Lazard ring <code>L</code>. </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",
