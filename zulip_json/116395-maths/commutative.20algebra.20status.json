I would really love to see Cohen structure theorem in lean. It's a fundamental result in commutative algebra and doing commutative algebra in lean is really fun once you get the knack of things. Why not write a blueprint? Would probably lead to an interesting paper, Exp Math told me they were interested in taking more formalisation papers.</p>",
