        "content": "<p>Hi Jo√´l,</p>\n<p>Great question.</p>\n<p>The core of the Whitehead theorem typically uses an extension property (HEP) such as the one in Hatcher's text on page 346. You're no doubt familiar with how such extension theorems lead to model structures, and so to answer your question I would like to illustrate the extension property that we will show. </p>\n<p>Firstly, instead of CW-complexes we use a quite similar object formed by attaching objects Œî‚Åø along their boundaries ‚àÇŒî‚Åø instead of discs D‚Çô along their boundaries S‚Åø. We show the theorem by induction, reducing to the case of a \"jar filling lemma\" which extends a homotopy along a single attachment. Maybe you see why I want to call this HEP a \"jar filling lemma\": the jar shape is created by gluing (‚àÇŒî‚Åø √ó I) with Œî‚Åø along ‚àÇŒî‚Åø. The existence of the extension uses the quasi-category lifting condition by extending one simplex at a time (followed by a lid which completes the desired homotopy extension).</p>\n<p>I hope this brief explanation of the relevant lifting lemma answers your question.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the October11th file does not feature this detail since I had only recently decided on a particular model. I also like the models you mention, and it would be great to hear your thoughts as to which model you think would be most useful or integrated.</p>",
