I can define all of this, but when I want to show that the Dedekind Integers are an instance of Ring <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Defs.html#Ring\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Defs.html#Ring</a> then I need to match up the equality of Ring with the equivalence of my integers. I did show that my integers are an instance of Setoid, but I dont know how to go on from there. How do I match up the equality of Ring with the equivalence relation that I defined for my integers?</p>",
