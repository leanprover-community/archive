It's quite decentralized, and most of them don't do it in the repository I created, and probably do their work for other reasons.

The idea was to prove it from RMK.<br>\nI was asked about the progress of the CLT by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"819544\">@Arav Bhattacharyya</span> a month ago and I suggested that Prokhorov's theorem could be a cool project.

The preliminaries mention many non-asymptotic techniques for proving concentration of measures that don't need the CLT.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We should have all the tools needed for the moment methods, even if we might not have the results themselves.</li>\n<li>You can see an example of the truncation technique in our proof of the strong law (by <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"110050\">Sébastien Gouëzel</span>), <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Probability/StrongLaw.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Probability/StrongLaw.html</a></li>\n<li>I recently added some results about moment generating functions and I am currently preparing PRs for concentration of sub-Gaussian random variables (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21387\">#21387</a>), and <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"558149\">Kei TSUKAMOTO</span> has an open PR for Hoeffding's lemma showing that bounded random variables are sub-Gaussian.</li>\n</ul>",
