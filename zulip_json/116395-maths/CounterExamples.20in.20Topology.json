I am a 5th year BS-MS student from IISc and I have been working on formalising Counter-Examples in Topology from this book :-<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterexamples_in_Topology\">Counter Examples in Topology</a> , here is my website<a href=\"https://shraze97.github.io/CounterExamples/CounterExamples.html\">CounterExamples</a>. So, any comments about my code will be deeply appreciated.The main objective of this project is to make Counter Examples and some tactics so that for any given conjecture in topology, one can use a formal tactic to specialize it for that particular topological space and give an instant disproof of it.</p>",
