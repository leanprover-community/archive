The main result is <a href=\"https://github.com/girving/ray/blob/main/src/mandelbrot.lean#L25\">https://github.com/girving/ray/blob/main/src/mandelbrot.lean#L25</a>.  Most of the work is done for a general holomorphic map from a compact Riemann surface to itself.  It's still Lean 3, but once I port it to Lean 4 it would be nice to upstream at least some of it (it defines complex manifolds, for instance).</p>",
