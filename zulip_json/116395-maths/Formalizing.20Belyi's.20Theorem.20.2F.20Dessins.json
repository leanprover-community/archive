So apologies if I am breaking rules. </p>\n<p>I've been considering formalization of Belyi’s Theorem and the theory of Dessins d'Enfants. Before I dive in, I wanted to check with the community to see if this is a realistic undertaking given the current state of Mathlib.<br>\n<strong>Questions I have in mind:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the \"easy\" algebraic direction (1) currently feasible with the state of function fields/projective curves in Mathlib? </li>\n<li>Is anyone currently working on formalizing <strong>Dessins d'Enfants</strong> (combinatorial maps) or Belyi's theorem? I’d hate to duplicate work!</li>\n<li>Would a formalization of just the combinatorial side (maps on surfaces) and the definition of a Belyi map be considered a useful contribution on its own?<br>\nAny insights or warnings about \"rabbit holes\" in this area would be appreciated!</li>\n</ul>",
