        "content": "<p>A discussion with my PhD student Jujian Zhang about how to define the dimension of a ring made me realise that arguably the \"correct\" target type for such a declaration is <code>with_bot cardinal</code>! For the empty ring probably has Krull dimension -infinity. I encouraged him to create a nat-valued definition but, in contrast to other \"garbage in, zero out\" definitions I've seen in mathlib, this one has both features of <code>nat_degree</code> (degree of 0 is -infty but let's call it 0) and <code>finrank</code> (dimension of infinite-dimensional space is +infinity but let's call it zero). This was initially funny, but it got a bit annoying when we wanted to give a name to the predicate meaning \"the answer being returned is actually mathematically meaningful\" -- we thought it would be \"is_finite_dimensional\" or some such thing, but with this zero ring nonsense it seems that a quotient of a finite-dimensional ring might not be finite-dimensional, and a subset of a finite-dimensional (in the weird alg geom sense of descending sequences of possibly non-closed points) might not be finite-dimensional. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, when I started looking through the books I found that a lot of people (even Matsumura!) seemed to be a bit unclear about what the dimension of the 0 ring was, and contained statements of the form \"Artinian rings are 0-dimensional\" (something which I've believed for years but now am slightly confused about, because I'm pretty sure the zero ring is Artinian). Is there an argument which says that the zero ring is 0-dimensional? Right now I'm a bit more convinced by the -infinity definition but I think I'm open to being persuaded that 0 is also a good answer -- I'm just not going a good job of convincing myself right now. The sup of the empty set of naturals is 0, if this helps, but the sup of the empty set of integers is not. Usually I feel like I'm quite clear on this kind of empty-set-ology question but here I seem to have confused myself.</p>",
