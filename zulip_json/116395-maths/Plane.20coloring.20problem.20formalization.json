I am happy to share <a href=\"https://github.com/vasnesterov/HadwigerNelson\">my formalization</a> of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger%E2%80%93Nelson_problem\">Hadwiger-Nelson problem</a> in Lean 4. I've formalized a recent breakthrough which proves that it's impossible to color the plane using only 4 colors such that no two points at distance 1 from each other have the same color.</p>\n<p>The proof relies heavily on SAT solvers, so I'm particularly grateful to the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/leansat\">LeanSAT</a> team for their work in integrating external SAT solvers with Lean. </p>\n<p>This is my first formalization project outside Mathlib, and I would be happy if someone could review it. I welcome all forms of feedback: pull requests, issues, questions, etc...!</p>",
