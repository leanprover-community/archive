So it makes no sense to feed to <code>deriv</code> a function defined on the positive reals. </p>\n<p>Mathlib does change rather frequently in a way that produces irritating minor breakage in dependent projects, which is why it's generally best to use the <code>lake</code> build system which allows you to key your project to a specific mathlib version (identified by its git commit id). However, that's not the explanation here: this particular design choice, that <code>deriv</code> expects a function on a field, has been set in stone since the very beginning of the project AFAIK – certainly well before I started using Lean. </p>\n<p>So, on the 30th line of your 1000+ line project, we encounter code which does not compile, and cannot possibly ever have compiled in any version of the software.

The type of the proposition is <code>True</code>, which is (by definition) always true. Just because the theorem is <em>named</em> <code>zeta_resonator_proves_RH</code>, it doesn't mean anything on its own—variable names have no effect in this regard. The type would have to be a formalized statement of the theorem to be proven, rather than just <code>True</code>, and then the inhabitant (which would presumably be more complicated than just <code>by trivial</code>) is a witness to the fact that the theorem holds. You need both 1) the correct type of the theorem and 2) to actually create an inhabitant of that type in order to know that Lean has actually verified your theorem to be true—merely one or the other (or in this case, neither) is not sufficient.</p>",
