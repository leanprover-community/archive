In a sledgehammer pipeline, the first form of premise selection you have is a relevance filter (sometimes a machine learning thing, sometimes a heuristic thing, sometimes a combination) that generates a ton of related lemmas from the library (think hundreds). Hooking Duper up to that directly wouldn't work well. However, in a sledgehammer pipeline, the second thing you do is send the problem (with all the lemmas from the relevance filter) off to an external prover which doesn't need to worry about proof production, and can therefore operate much more efficiently. Then, if the external prover succeeds, it can send back just the lemmas it actually used to obtain a proof. I'm optimistic that Duper will be able to perform reasonably well given just the lemmas that an external prover like Zipperposition needed to solve the problem.</p>",

I'd have to double check that. But in either case, there aren't any current plans for Duper to support domain-specific reasoning (besides what it can figure out if you just give it a bunch of domain-specific lemmas). The first target is to get a full sledgehammer pipeline for problems that are essentially first-order or higher-order. Once we're past that target, it might be interesting to explore integrating more domain-specific things into Duper, but that's much farther away.</p>",

However, when preprocessing is disabled, Duper does have some heuristics in place to prefer reasoning about clauses that are closely derived from the goal. Currently, there are some technical issues that prevent us from using those same heuristics when preprocessing is enabled (it's nontrivial to determine which of the facts output by Auto's preprocessing and monomorphization procedures were derived from the goal), but that is a problem that we are actively working on, and our intent is to at least reach a state where those same heuristics can be used regardless of whether Duper is using Auto's preprocessing and monomorphization procedures.</p>",

There are some SMT solvers whose proofs Isabelle can use for more direct proof reconstruction (Z3 and veriT). However, the set of external provers that the sledgehammer will call is larger than the set of provers for which this direct proof reconstruction is possible. So there are some instances in which Isabelle will achieve proof reconstruction by actually following the proof output by an external solver, but there are other instances where this approach isn't feasible and so the lemma-based proof reconstruction approach (i.e. just using the external solver to figure out which lemmas you need) is still used.</p>",
