Regarding things about compactly generated spaces, I think we can add them just for the sake of deducing the sequential and locally compact special cases, with a comment saying that when we have defined compactly generated spaces we should move to that definition and remove the special cases (since the gap will be bridged by typeclass inference).</p>",
