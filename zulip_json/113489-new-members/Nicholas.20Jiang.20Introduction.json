I wanted to do work involving Lean ever since playing the Natural Number Game (NNG) <a href=\"https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4\">https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4</a> . Right now I'm really interested in developing approaches/models to improve on relevant benchmarks for theorem provers such as PutnamBench. Happy to be a part of the community! I look forward to chatting with others. Here is my digital profile: <a href=\"https://script-jpg.github.io/profile/\">https://script-jpg.github.io/profile/</a></p>",
