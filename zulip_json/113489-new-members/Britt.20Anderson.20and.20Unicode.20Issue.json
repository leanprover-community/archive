I am a cognitive neuroscientist interested in the idea of writing cognitive models in a language where one can, in principle, verify claims, but that one can also just use for scientific computing. So, I decided to try it out. </p>\n<p>One minor snafu I am having is that the unicode/blackboard characters appear in my IDE (both emacs and vscode), but in neither are they recognized. <br>\nFor example, the first  line below is fine. The second I produced by typing \"\\N\" (without quotes), but it is being treated as a different type. If I hover over the \"Nat\" it tells me \"Type\" if I hover over the blackboard N I get \"Type u_1\". I can just type out the full names, but it would be nice to get this working. Anyone have an idea what setting I fouled up? Thanks. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Nat</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">4</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
