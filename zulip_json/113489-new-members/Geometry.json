The point is that the angle determined by 3 equal points (or more generally, 3 collinear points) is just not proper (see <code>ang_proper_iff_noncol</code>). Then in many theorems, properness of the angle is a hypothesis, see for instance <code>three_pt_ang_eq_iff_prep</code>.</p>",

Actually, the book I am following, Euclidean Geometry and Beyond by Hartshrone, uses the convention that three points must be noncollinear to define an angle. Indeed, most of the times we only care about 'proper' angles. However, if we use that definition in Lean, sometimes the theorem statement could be very messy since defining every angle involves proving the noncollinearity, so I didn't demand the points to be collinear and as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197836\">@Jireh Loreaux</span>  said, I usually put properness condition in the statement. I guess the most results work in degenerate cases, but really we don't think of Euclidean geometry in that way. Plus, checking all the degenerate cases could be a disaster in Lean when there are many points.</p>",
