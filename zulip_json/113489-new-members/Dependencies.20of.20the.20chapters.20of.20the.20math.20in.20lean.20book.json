It seems like they are the more foundational chapters that are needed for anyone that uses lean to prove mathematical theorems and most of the other chapters are more about showcasing theorem proving in specific math subjects (perhaps with the exception of the fourth chapter which is about set theory and functions? although lean is based on type theory, so I think sets are not really foundational, right?). <br>\nI was wondering if one could learn whichever chapters one is interested in after the first 3 chapters, or are there any dependencies between the chapters. And also, if there aren't any dependencies, is there some order which is more optimal pedagogically?</p>",
