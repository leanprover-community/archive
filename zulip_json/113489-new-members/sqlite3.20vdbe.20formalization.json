Also, as SQLite VM programs are guided by SQL queries - they are usually have simple shape, so that potentially manageable set of predefined tactics can prove different properties automatically for most of the cases. </p>\n<p>As an attempt to move towards the goal of formalized SQLite VDBE I translated simple select query and proved it's termination. To expand the goal, I collected few more queries and created repo where proving progress can be tracked: <a href=\"https://github.com/sivukhin/sqlite3-lean-proofs\">https://github.com/sivukhin/sqlite3-lean-proofs</a></p>\n<p>I will be glad to work on this more, but I am newbie in Lean. So, if anyone has some suggestions, want to join the effort or maybe there are some components which can help with this work - I will glad to hear this feedback!</p>",
