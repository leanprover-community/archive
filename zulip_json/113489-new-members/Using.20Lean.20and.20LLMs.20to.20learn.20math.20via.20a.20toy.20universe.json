I started a few projects playing with cellular automata, but I found myself more interested in understanding static structures than simulations.</p>\n<p>I created Diaspora as an effort to explore formal structure that was compatible with my philosophical intuitions. Mainly around perspectives, constraints, novelty, creation of structure. Diaspora morphed into a toy universe built on hodge theory and graphs. So on top of being a tour through math for me, it became a tour through physics. <a href=\"https://github.com/typhdotcom/diaspora\">https://github.com/typhdotcom/diaspora\n</a></p>\n<p>It's very much an LLM-collaborated \"vibe math\" project, so it comes with the usual pitfalls: messy lean, naive interpretations, hallucination. Sometimes portions of it crumble. I'm ok with that- often dissecting where I went wrong is when I learn the most.</p>\n<p>It's hard to know where to share such a project, because sharing vibe code feels kinda like sharing a dream. But I figure a new member post is low stakes, and I'm probably not the only person interested in Lean for this type of exploration.</p>",
