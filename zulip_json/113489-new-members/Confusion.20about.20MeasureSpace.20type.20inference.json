I was confused by this, because I didn't specify a joint measure, but  it seems that this is a MeasureSpace, and from the below my understanding is that Lean found MeasureSpace.pi and constructed it by taking the product measure. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Mathlib</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">MeasureTheory</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Measure</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Map</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Mathlib</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Probability</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Kernel</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">CondDistrib</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">open</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">MeasureTheory</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">variable</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">Ω</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">MeasureSpace</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Ω</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">variable</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">#</span><span class=\"n\">synth</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">MeasureSpace</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Fin</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Ω</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>How would I have determined that this would have been the default joint measure?
