I’ve recently become interested in formal verification/type theory etc which brought me here.</p>\n<p>I’m generally interested in using Lean to build dependent-typed DSLs for cryptographic applications (such as SNARKs for example). I’m interested in lean both as a theorem prover but also potentially as a somewhat more general purpose programming language for cryptographic implementations. As such, I’m very interested in learning more about writing performant code in Lean. Glad to meet you all!</p>",
