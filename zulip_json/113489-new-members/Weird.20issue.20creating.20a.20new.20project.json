        "content": "<p>Hello, I have been working with Lean for quite some time now, but I have never set up a project myself. <br>\nToday, I tried setting up a new project by myself on my Linux laptop for the first time. Basically, I followed the instructions under <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html#creating-a-lean-project\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html#creating-a-lean-project</a> and created a new project called </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_project</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>under the path</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">PROJECT</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">my_project</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Everything seemed to have worked fine, after following the instructions, the folder under </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">PROJECT</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">my_project</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>contained a lakefile.lean, a lean-toolchain, a .git-subfolder, a .gitignore-file, a project.lean and a subfolder </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">PROJECT</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">my_project</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">My_Project</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>containing a Basic.lean file. The problem was when I tried to open the my_project folder in VS-Code, I couldn't work at the Basic.lean-file. I got syntax-highlighting, but I couldn't toggle an infoview, the key shortcut didn't work and the \\forall-sign in the upper left corner only showed options like \"Open Project...\" and \"Search with Loogle\", but not \"Toggle infoview\" like it usually does. Also, the file didn't get executed.</p>\n<p>When opening VS-code, it showed me the following infobox:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Lean</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">version</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">'</span><span class=\"n\">leanprover</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">lean4</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">v4</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"m\">23</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"m\">0</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">rc2'</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">of</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Lean</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">project</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">'</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">PROJECT</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">my_project</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">My_Project'</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">is</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">not</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">installed</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Do</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">you</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">wish</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">to</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">install</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">it?</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But when I clicked 'yes' the download never finished / got aborted. What I find weird is that under </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">mathematics_in_lean</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I have stored the Mathematics in Lean project, which I can open, execute and work on in VScode as usual.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have an idea what I've been doing wrong? Any help is appreciated!</p>",
