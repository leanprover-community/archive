At least that's the quick answer. <br>\nIf you use <code>have</code> to \"define\" something like a natural number or a function, then lean will only remember that it's a term of the given type without actually remembering the definition you give. In those cases you should use <code>let</code> (or better, mathlib's <code>set</code>)</p>",
