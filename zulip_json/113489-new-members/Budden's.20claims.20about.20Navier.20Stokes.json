Rather than \"We found this little bug, fix it, and it should be fine\", the status is \"We didn't even look into the deep math yet, and already found three flaws, so we are afraid that the whole formalization needs to be rewritten with experts.\" If there are indeed (as you suggest) people willing to spend their time on formalizing &amp; checking the formalization of Navier Stokes, then great. Otherwise, I am not sure exactly what the github issue should say besides \"Navier Stokes is wrong, here is an example how we can make the current version trivial, more work &amp; examination needs to be done.\"</p>",

Not because of the millennium problems, or even the smaller ones as you mention. I do share those concerns but am more motivated by the following point: the stakes surrounding claims of proofs in Lean have increased substantially. This community has suddenly, and somewhat unexpectedly, found itself close to the center of a technology with significant downstream consequences. Here is what I mean:</p>\n<p>For many years, proving mathematical statements in Lean was low stakes in the sense that few, if any, people outside of the math/Lean community cared if there was a mistake in a formalization of a mathematical proof. Yes, people used Lean to engineer and ensure safety aspects of critical systems, but that's not what I'm talking about. That was and still is important in the way that I am suggesting.</p>\n<p>What has changed is the importance of things like proofs of IMO problems. A few years ago if we mis-formalized some random problem or validated a proof that hid the exploitation of some bug, it really didn't matter as there were no externalities. Now, all of a sudden, this is not the case. People are using Lean to evaluate (and more importantly, increase) the capability of their LLMs. Then, they are using those LLMs to attempt things like accelerate the rate of discovery in science, capture trillions of dollars in value via automating labor, and pursue other high-impact goals. What we are doing here matters for the rest of the world, even if most people are completely unaware that we exist.</p>\n<p>What concerns me most is the speed at which all of this is happening. A year ago, o1 had just been released as the first \"thinking\" model, and it was fairly inept at writing proofs in Lean. Now <a href=\"#narrow/channel/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving/topic/AI-discovered.20proof.20on.20psi-integrals.20.28with.20Lean.20formalizat.2E.29/with/564826085\">things like this</a> are happening.
