        "content": "<p>Hi, I’ve recently completed a project in Lean formalizing several notions of presentation invariant algebraic theories (abstract clones, Lawvere theories, length-bijective C-systems, substitution algebras, substitution monoids, and finitary monads), the associated categories, and several equivalences and isomorphisms of these categories, establishing that they are all equivalent. This involved several standard results in category theory such as the skeleton category of finite sets is finitely cocomplete, the equivalence between strongly and weakly finitary functors in the category of sets, fubini interchange of iterated ends / coends, the coend formula of the left-kan extension, etc. I was wondering if any of this might be suitable to include somewhere in Mathlib. I would be happy to provide more details / code if so.</p>",
