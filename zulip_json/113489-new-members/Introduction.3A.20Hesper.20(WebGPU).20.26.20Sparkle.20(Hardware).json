I previously contributed to Hasktorch(Haskell bindings for PyTorch), and now I'm diving into Lean 4.</p>\n<p>I'm currently developing two projects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hesper: A DNN framework using WebGPU with verification. <a href=\"https://github.com/Verilean/hesper\">https://github.com/Verilean/hesper</a></li>\n<li>Sparkle: An RTL generator with verification. <a href=\"https://github.com/Verilean/sparkle\">https://github.com/Verilean/sparkle</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>My goal is to connect CPU, GPU, and hardware through formal verification. Both projects are still in the alpha stage, so if you have any advice or feedback, I would really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Lean 4 is great! Thanks.</p>",

It sounds like a fantastic initiative.</p>\n<p>I have great respect for Mr. Satnam Singh and his pioneering work on Lava. His research has been a huge inspiration for my Sparkle project, so I would be honored to speak with him.</p>\n<p>I will apply for the sponsorship program right away.
