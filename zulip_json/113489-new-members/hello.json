At the moment we have no graph theory in <code>mathlib</code>, the \"standard library\" for maths in Lean. But there have been several attempts at getting something done. The last attempt is currently WIP on the <code>hedetniemi</code> branch of the repository. (I don't know if you are familiar with git/github.) You can browse the code here: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/hedetniemi/src/graph_theory\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/hedetniemi/src/graph_theory\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/hedetniemi/src/graph_theory</a></p>",
