I think formal proof languages are pretty cool from an aesthetics standpoint and might also unlock a new paradigm for machine learning.</p>\n<p>I come from a math olympiad background, and I'm most interested in combinatorics and number theory. I'm working through the Mathematics in Lean tutorial, and I've learned chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 so far.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to get an idea of what I can do to get more involved with the community (e.g. how to start contributing to Mathlib). I'm not set on any specific \"path\" yet; I just want to get a feel for what I can work on in the near future.</p>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>",
