But I have also seen things like <code>m!\"{term}\"</code> in  <em>HitchHiker Guide to Logical Verification</em> and <code>f!\"{declName\"}</code> in <em>Metaprogramming in Lean 4</em>. Is there documentation that lists all such string literal prefixes and explains their meanings? Pointers greatly appreciated.</p>",
