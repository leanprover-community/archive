Now we're working on the p → q case.  Can I somehow bring in the additional hypothesis <code>a ≥ b</code> to help me out in that case? (Rationale: if it weren't true then we would be in the <code>a &lt; b</code> case and we would already be done.)  I am not having any luck finding anything about this kind of reasoning in the manual. In case it matters, a and b are Nat.</p>",
