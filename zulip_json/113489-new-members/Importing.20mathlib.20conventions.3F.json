This does raise an interesting point, the conventions are surprisingly silent about namespaces. <br>\n2) Again there <code>Real</code> refers to the namespace, which is a convenient way to distinguish things to which we would like to give the same name, compare <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Real.exp#doc\">docs#Real.exp</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Complex.exp#doc\">docs#Complex.exp</a><br>\nThere’s  nothing special about <code>Real.Basic</code>, except that it’s meant to signify that it sets up the basic theory of real numbers (in particular, their definition)<br>\n3) Like in most programming languages, importing is transitive (i.e. if you import A, and A imports B, you also get B). There’s a lake command to view the import graph if I remember correctly.<br>\n4) You are confusing namespaces with filenames. lean is more like C/C++ and less like python, in that the file name is pretty much completely irrelevant as far as the software is concerned</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you are curious as to why namespaces have nothing to do with the directory structure, one of the many reasons is that Lean cannot handle circular imports (since that would let you use mutual recursion and create proofs of <code>False</code>). So if we tied namespaces to the directory structure, then everything in the <code>Nat</code> namespace would have to be declared in one file, early in the inheritance hierarchy. Then we couldn't have things like <code>Nat.nth</code>, because that depends on something in <code>Mathlib.Data.Finset.Sort</code>, which in turn depends on the file in which <code>Nat</code> is declared. Basically, the way it is set up right now allows you to add to the <code>Nat</code> namespace later.</p>\n<p>Importing has to be transitive because if B depends on A, then B might use a type or declaration in A, and if you were writing file C and were able to import B but not A, then those definitions from B might not make any sense.</p>",
