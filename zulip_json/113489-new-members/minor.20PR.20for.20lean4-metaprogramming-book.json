I came across a minor typo in the tactics chapter for which I raised a <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-metaprogramming-book/pull/145\">PR</a>. Please let me know if it is acceptable.  I would like to learn by contributing, so if you can suggest any beginner friendly issues, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you!</p>",

I have also used C/C++/Python in the past. Few years ago I came across Haskell and since then I have been trying to wrap my head around it. Lean seems very similar. I am curious about the theorem proving aspect of it and the meta programming part. </p>\n<p>I do have some background in Math and Physics, having studied Physics at graduate level, but that was a while back :-). My math skills at this point may not suffice for using Lean for Math proofs, but I should be able to contribute to any programming related tasks/issues.</p>",
