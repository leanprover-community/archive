However, I have encountered a problem that seems to require generating functions for the proof. So far, I have considered using induction, but I am unable to complete the proof. Could anyone share some ideas or methods to solve this problem in Lean 4?

I have already completed the proofs for simpler combinatorial identities before, but as the difficulty increased, I found it challenging (especially when it involves probability and calculus). Apologies, but I have not thought through the steps for this particular problem. May I first come up with steps in natural language and then consult you to see if these steps are feasible?</p>",
