Unless you want to tie your hands behind your back to solve some simple exercises form scratch, I would recommend <code>import Mathlib.Tactic</code> to get a decent amount of results.  Note that <code>import Mathlib</code> gives you essentially everything that is available and should be quick if you have a working cache, so that is also an option.</p>",
