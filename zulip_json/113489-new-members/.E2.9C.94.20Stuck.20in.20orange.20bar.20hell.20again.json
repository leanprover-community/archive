Once in a while, after I've pulled and opened up VSCode, I am required to restart a file due to imports being out of date. Fair enough. But when I do that, my VSCode/Lean decides that it needs to re-build a large portion of mathlib. This takes very long and obviously prevents me from working. Why does this happen?<br>\nWe did not change the mathlib version used in the project. Running <code>lake exe cache get</code>, which I'm told downloads the built mathlib files, just returns:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">No</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">files</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">to</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">download</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Decompressing</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">5876</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">file</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Unpacked</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">in</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1767</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ms</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Completed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">successfully!</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Is this not enough? What can I do except waiting for Lean to build the mathlib files?</p>",
