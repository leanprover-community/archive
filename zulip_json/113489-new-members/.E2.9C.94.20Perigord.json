This discussion of <code>Proof</code> was more to explain a possible way that logic <em>could</em> be encoded in Lean, not how it actually is. Lean actually expresses proofs without the <code>Proof</code> type. It explains later that  if <code>P</code> is a proposition then instead of writing <code>Proof P</code> to represent the types of proofs of <code>P</code>, we can just consider <code>P</code> to be the type of its own proofs (this is the subject of the rest of the chapter).</p>",
