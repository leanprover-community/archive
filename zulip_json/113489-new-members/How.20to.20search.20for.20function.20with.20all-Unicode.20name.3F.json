I can easily find pull up the documentation for this function in my editor--which is great--but I I can't figure out how to search for it in the API documentation, Loogle, or Moogle.  Is there some trick to searching for Unicode-only names in the documentation?  Sometimes it's helpful to see what module a function comes from in order to find out how general it is, to find out what other names it might have, or to see what related definitions there are in the same module.</p>",
