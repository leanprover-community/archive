Here's the quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the first two examples, the fields of the structure are named explicitly. In the first case, because Lean knows that the expected type of my_point1 is a point, you can start the definition by writing an underscore, _. Clicking on the light bulb that appears nearby in VS Code will then give you the option of inserting a template definition with the field names listed for you.</p>\n</blockquote>",
