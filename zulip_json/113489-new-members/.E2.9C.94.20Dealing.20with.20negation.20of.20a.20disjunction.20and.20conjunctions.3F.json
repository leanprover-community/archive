For instance, when I use <code>tauto</code> on a <code>¬ (P ∨ Q)</code>it gives me <code>¬ (P )</code> and <code>¬ (Q)</code> as new hypotheses but I can't use the <code>rw</code> tactic on those new hypotheses... the seem kind of broken. </p>\n<p>What tactics can I use to reliably split a <code>¬ (P ∨ Q)</code> into <code>¬ (P )</code> and <code>¬ (Q)</code> hypotheses?  How can I reliably change <code>¬ (P ∧ Q)</code> to <code>¬P ∨ ¬ Q)</code>?</p>",
