Can you recommend one, where a beginner could be helpful? As a first step, I would feel more comfortable working on a topic related to discrete structures (combinatorics, finite group theory, etc.).</p>\n<p>To be honest, whenever I look at some proofs in mathlib, I feel humbled by how complex the whole library is, but I hope I can get used to it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The proofs in mathlib are not really written to be readable by the beginner for the most part. It doesn't have to be like this, for example in the module topology file I've been writing normal proofs in comments amongst the lean proofs and nobody's objected. But this is not the norm. The trick with reading the maths library is not to read the proofs but just to read and understand the statements of the theorems, probably in most cases the proof is \"this follows without too much trouble from what has already been proved\" and unfortunately this sometimes turns into \"...and so let's see if we can smoosh the entire argument together into under two lines\".</p>",
