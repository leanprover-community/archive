But this is where I get stuck.</p>\n<p>I do have <code>le_zero</code> in my arsenal:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">le_zero</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hx</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">≤</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So naturally what I want is to apply <code>le_zero</code> to my <code>h</code> to get <code>a = 0</code> that I can later use. But how do I do that? The only relevant tactics we've learned in NNG so far seem to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>apply</code>: It goes <em>backwards</em> so not what I want. I.e. It would help me get from <code>a = 0</code> in a goal to <code>a &lt;= 0</code> but I want to do the opposite to my hypothesis.</li>\n<li><code>exact</code>: This works as a \"last step\" (if <code>a = 0</code> <em>was</em> my goal I could just write <code>exact le_zero a h</code>). But I'm not at the last step yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is the problem just that we're not yet familiar (at this level of NNG) with creating intermediate variables and so I'm really being forced to \"massage\" my goals first? I.e. I really have to work backwards before trying to apply this?</p>\n<p>Or am I missing some basic method that was taught earlier in NNG?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
