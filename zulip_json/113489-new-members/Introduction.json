At very least you'd need your neural nets to be able to identify when they're outputting junk for people to be able to trust them for peer review (false positives). I think grammar based approaches are able to achieve this accuracy, plus with PCFG methods you're able to interact with the user and say \"I tried to translate this and got it wrong. Did you mean ____?\" Plus grammars are pretty mature, for instance the Penn Treebank system is almost 30 years old.</p>",

In my mind it would be great if mathlib was growing with the optimistic goal of eventually absorbing most of the maths literature. If this is the goal then it makes sense for theorems like this (and I plan to do much more if I can) to be added to mathlib. However I don't really know what the current vision of mathlib is. There may also be standards for proofs being written efficiently which mine probably doesn't meet (there was a lot of guessing when I made it). There are probably also conventions on distribution of lemmas through files etc. I would like to start contributing but don't know where to go from here. Should I just make it as tidy as I can and make a PR? Or is there something else I should do?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a fellow mathlib novice, I would like to recommend the following pages to you:</p>\n<p>vision and goals of mathlib:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mathlib-initiative.org/roadmap/\">https://mathlib-initiative.org/roadmap/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mathlib-initiative.org/about/\">https://mathlib-initiative.org/about/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09336\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09336</a> (this is older)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>contribution and style guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html</a> (also contains information on what kinds of contributions can be made)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/doc.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/doc.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/commit.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/commit.html</a></li>\n</ul>",
