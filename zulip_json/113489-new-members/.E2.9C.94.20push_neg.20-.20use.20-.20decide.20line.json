I built a small tool on top of Vampire in order to adjust operation tables (related to magma implications), and found it useful, but not strong enough.

The agent would run something like <a href=\"https://github.com/riccitensor/vampirellm\">this</a> in a loop (well, C, not Python like in this case), and continuously adjust the TPTP file, collect the feedback from Vampire (or something else), learn, and repeat. </p>\n<p>One could probably have something like this running in the bg.
