I've enjoyed working through the \"Mathematics in Lean\" documentation and I'm learning more by formalizing some of my recent homework problems.  I've already solved one of my issues in the process of typing up a question for this chat <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> so I'm looking forward to hanging out here more over the holidays</p>",

Lifting a syntactic object to something treated as a<br>\nproposition requires an explicit, well-typed coercion.</p>\n<p>Under this constraint, classical self-referential constructions<br>\n(e.g. Liar-style / Gödel-style descriptions)<br>\nfail to form as valid propositions — Lean blocks them as ill-typed<br>\nat formation time.</p>\n<p>The Lean files are complete and fully type-check.</p>\n<p>Repo:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/najih7777777-cpu/pre-semantic-type-validation\">https://github.com/najih7777777-cpu/pre-semantic-type-validation</a></p>\n<p>Any technical feedback is very welcome.</p>",
