Or is this already written somewhere in the mathlib3? Or I have to prove this using induction on natural numbers? I find that I need to spend much time on statements about monoids (more precisely, <code>linear_ordered_comm_monoid_with_zero</code>) when I want to discuss local fields, extension of valuations, etc. I wonder is there something as powerful as the tactic <code>ring</code> that applies to monoids? Thank you very much!</p>",
