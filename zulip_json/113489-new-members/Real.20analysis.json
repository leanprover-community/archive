Is there a workaround in mathlib for limsup/liminfs without having to use filters? I apologize if this is not the correct channel. Please let me know which channel I can ask these types of questions.</p>",

And I really recommend you do it.</p>\n<p>But if you really don't want to, you can just define your own limsup functions and provide the basic lemmas to interact with them (i.e. the equivalent of \"limsup_eq\")</p>\n<p>Note that making the right definitions is a non-trivial step in the way to learning Lean, and not everyone may realise that. Having wrong definitions really slows one down.</p>",
