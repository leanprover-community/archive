These proof terms aren't available in the proof state, but they are very simple to create using a have statement with a single tactic. E.g. <code>have hblabla : MeasurableSet (A \\ B) := by measurability</code>.</p>\n<p>Now my question is, can I combine the creation of the term <code>hblabla</code> and the <code>rw</code> in one line of code? I.e. <code>rw [measure_union &lt;put proof term for MeasurableSet (A\\B) here&gt;]</code>?</p>",
