I installed lean using the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lean_Theorem_Prover\">instructions on the Arch Linux wiki</a> after which I installed the lean4 plugin for vscode (the OSS version, so the plugin is from Open VSX). It happily evaluates <code>#eval Lean.versionString</code> to the version I installed (nightly-2023-06-20). However, when I start a project using <code>$(elan which lake) new ...</code>, vscode can't create a connection to the language server, saying <code>Launching server using command lake failed. Error: spawn lake ENOENT</code>. Note that <code>lake</code> is not a command on my machine, I have to use <code>$(elan which lake)</code>. Thanks in advance!</p>",
