(also serving for a further goal of proving properties about <code>ℂ_p</code> )  Is there some project similar already in progress? If so, should I talk with someone to see if we could collaborate? I know that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"406490\">@María Inés de Frutos Fernández</span> has made some progress on local fields. <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></p>\n<p>A reference I choose is the second chapter of Neukirch's <em>Algebraic Number Theory</em>. Maybe someone has some better material in mind?</p>\n<p>I haven't contributed to mathlib before, but I really hope to make contributions to mathlib this time. Is this a good topic that mathlib4 will record? Is there some written style guidance of mathlib I need to learn, or someone I need to discuss with before I start on working on the project? Or should I first write then gradually modify the project to meet the standard of mathlib? I really know nothing about how to contribute to mathlib. <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span></p>\n<p>Any suggestions is welcome! Thanks in advance!</p>",
