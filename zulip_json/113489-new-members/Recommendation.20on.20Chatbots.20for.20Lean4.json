None of them seem to work very well. The zulip is great, but there are times when you want a more interactive and immediate approach. With much more lean3 than lean4 in the training data I don't find I get legal code all that often. I am wondering if there are any recommendations for which of the commonly available chatbots seem at the present time to be best at giving small snippets of legal lean4 code. Thanks.</p>",
