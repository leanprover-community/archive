But instead of <code>^ω</code>, what I really want is a superscript ω, similar to the notation for set complementation which is a superscript <code>c</code>.  But I don't know how to achieve that.  In particular, I don't know (1) how to get that unicode character and (2) how to define the key binding for producing that character in VScode.  I'd appreciate any pointer to how to do these goals.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">@[</span><span class=\"n\">notation_class</span><span class=\"kd\">]</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">class</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">OmegaPower</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">β</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">outParam</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">where</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">omegaPower</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">β</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">postfix</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">1024</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"^ω\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">OmegaPower</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">omegaPower</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
