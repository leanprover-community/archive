I have no idea what magic nonsense is causing it to suddenly do that and I have to teach in an hour and then work after that so I don't have time to look at the minute -- if things are working and it just started happening it's almost certainly nothing you did. Feel free to open an issue and I can find why lazy.nvim is trying to detect where to install things from without being asked to.</p>",

If so, it's probably a good opportunity for me to open a github account, since I plan in the future to contribute to mathlib. Anyway thank you very much for taking the time to respond despite being so busy, take your time, don't feel pressure, as I said  lean still works despite this error message.</p>",
