        "content": "<p>The question \"what's needed to prove FLT\" is basically orthogonal to constructivity. If you think about what FLT actually says from a constructive perspective, it's clear that it has no constructive content. If you have a proof of FLT in something like ZFC, I believe it should automatically give a proof in \"constructive Lean\" (i.e. Lean without axioms). Namely, I would expect that in constructive Lean you can build a model of IZF, use a double-negation translation from ZF to IZF, and then a translation from ZFC to ZF to see that constructive Lean proves ZFC consistent. And if ZFC is consistent, then FLT does hold. The more meaningful questions are: a) can you develop e.g. scheme theory constructively in a satisfactory way (beyond what is necessary for FLT -- for FLT it should be possible to cheat and use some double negation translations), and b) can you prove FLT in systems with lower proof-theoretic strength (e.g. MLTT or CZF or PA or PRA) -- this is what McLarty writes about. Conventional wisdom says that the answer is \"yes\" to both questions. Note that a) is necessarily imprecise. At a surface level, modern algebraic is non-constructive in the sense that many important results become invalid in a constructive setting. But that doesn't preclude the possibility of finding reformulations that are valid. Indeed there are always trivial reformulations that are constructively valid (e.g. replace \"X\" by \"if AC holds then X\"). Constructivists expect most results of algebraic geometry to have more satisfactory constructive reformulations, but finding them and proving them is hard work (maybe sometimes almost as hard as the work of developing algebraic geometry classically in the first place).</p>",

Can this be done without AC? All the people who know the relevant harmonic analysis would, I suspect, not be remotely interested in finding out the answer to this question, because whether or not a proof uses AC is rather a niche question in mainstream maths circles.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3507072/proof-of-fermats-last-theorem-uses-which-set-theory-axioms-which-are-used-gene\">This guy</a> said \"Many experts suspect that Wiles's proof of FLT can be converted into a proof in Peano arithmetic which is much weaker than set theory, see Are there non-standard counterexamples to the Fermat Last Theorem? and What is known about the relationship between Fermat's last theorem and Peano Arithmetic?  If this is possible then we only need axioms of set theory sufficient to derive Peano arithmetic. This would mean that <strong>axioms of choice, infinity and replacement are not needed</strong>, they are used to deal with infinite sets. What is left is a theory of finite sets, which is more or less equivalent to arithmetic, see Systems the Peano axioms can be derived in. But so far whether it can be done or not is an open question. As Colin McLarty writes in What Does It Take to Prove Fermat's Last Theorem:  \"Angus Macintyre lays out a program to express the Modularity Thesis (MT) central to Wiles [1995] as a statement of arithmetic and argues that it is provable in PA. This program could lead to a PA proof of MT, and possibly one of FLT without using MT. It calls for substantial new work in arithmetic. While closely based on Wiles [1995] it is no routine adaptation.\"\"</p>",

When I was a grad student I had a variety of fellowships and odd jobs to carry me through.  The last bits of academic funding in my 5th year of grad school were from <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/3075\">ESPRIT ALCOM</a> grants.  In general, as a grad student, my funding came from faculty funding.   Grad students were never really self-funding.  It was always up to faculty to find and apply to grant opportunities.  For that, they needed to know where they were.  In the US, this would mean, for computer science, going to BAA Presenter's Days of a <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/office-wide-broad-agency-announcements\">DARPA</a> or an <a href=\"https://www.iarpa.gov/engage-with-us/open-baas\">IARPA</a>.  A place like CMU becomes a place like CMU because professors go to meetings in Washington and hustle.  The trickle-down effect of the hustling is funding for grad students.  What I was attempting to demonstrate with the search above was the faculty-level hustle: doing a broad search for who to cold-call.  </p>\n<p>I mentioned Rick Rashid at Microsoft.  He is thoroughly retired and only available on Facebook.  I was about to send him a message and point him to this thread.  Post-Microsoft he was on the board of several foundations.  Now he is emeritus of Microsoft and emeritus of the boards.

This was in response to a comment the previous year that measure theory was a real challenge to do constructively. So, ok, we can properly and constructively define something like Lebesgue integration, only 102 years after Lebesgue gave his definition. Getting to the point of all the constructive analysis needed for the work of eg Langlands–Tunnell is non trivial, and I don't know if anyone has even looked to see what we are missing as far as tools to even attempt it. Moving to the fully constructive setting throws up all kinds of subtleties that are completely invisible to classical mathematicians, much as formalism does.</p>\n<p>As Kevin has repeatedly said: it's possible, with lots and lots of money and people who are willing to basically bet their entire careers on contributing years of work to a project that very few people seem to want done. It's not just the money, if a passing billionaire wanted to done a spare $1B to pay for this to be done, you'd then have to find people expert enough in both Lean (or willing to learn) and the hard-core mathematics who are also willing to maybe not ever get a permanent job in a mathematics department. And that number is rather small, making the project look very long and very slow.</p>",

You are correct, there has been recent progress regarding the formalization of Fermat's Last Theorem in the Lean theorem prover.

        "content": "<p>A very simple argument in favor of <em>interactive</em> theorem proving versus <em>automated</em> theorem proving is this: Many proofs rely on automated search procedures like <code>linarith</code> or <code>ring</code>.  These sometimes are slow.   For set theory, there are <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-4282-9_5\">decision procedures for fragments of set theory</a>.  These are hyperexponential in complexity.  So imagine we work out all of FLT but there is a short bottleneck section involving just 10 variables involving one of these fragments of set theory that has a decision procedure.  We run the procedure.  It turns out that the branch that completes the proof is the last one enumerated by the procedure.  It takes a billion years to find that branch.   But, a mathematician with more insight, faced with that 10-variable problem, knowing more about the structure of the problem, can find the right branch in a day, using an interactive theorem prover.   That's the funding case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306601\">@Kyle Miller</span> ,  I was not trying to suggest that faculty in this field are not hustling enough.  I would guess though that the kind of hustle that brings massive funding like CMU CS Dept has in its various enterprises results from a different skill set.  I was trying to share my limited understanding of what the fund-raising skill set breaks down into: Finding places and people with money who care about this problem.  Sometimes you know somebody who knows somebody, but sometimes you have to cold call widely.  It's not a fun or comfortable thing to do.  Very rarely does one person have both technical skill and fund-raising skill.  Part of the search is to find those people and ask them for ideas and help.</p>\n<p>One example of such a person in this field is <a href=\"https://www3.risc.jku.at/people/buchberger/\">Bruno Buchberger</a>.  He is so successful that he <a href=\"https://risc.jku.at/the-castle-of-hagenberg/\">works in a castle</a>, has built <a href=\"https://www.softwarepark-hagenberg.com/en/\">an industrial park hosting 70 firms</a>, and is now <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iau7LFrmlVg\">sharing the keys to inner peace.</a>  Maybe you can get in touch with Prof. Buchberger, through mutual friends of friends, and ask him how to solve the funding problem for interactive proof assistants.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"iau7LFrmlVg\" href=\"https://youtu.be/iau7LFrmlVg\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/2bbee0136587576d0895333e0548fbb7ba23cf27/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f696175374c46726d6c56672f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><p>People with both empire-building skills and math skills are extremely rare.  No one should feel bad for not being geniuses at empire building.  A more typical case is my undergrad logic professor, <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/math/people/faculty/andrews.html\">Peter Andrews</a>.  He developed a theorem prover he called System Q.  He developed and copyrighted a special font for System Q, subsequently <a href=\"https://gtps.math.cmu.edu/tps.html\">ETPS</a>, with existential quantifiers.  As far as I know, he did not succeed in building and funding a big ongoing ETPS community.  That's the more usual case.</p>",
