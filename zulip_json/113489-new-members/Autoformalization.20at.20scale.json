Is it good enough in principle, and if so, why isn’t it used more routinely? Are the main blockers pedagogical or cultural, cost, review and trust issues, tech-debt and maintainability, or the fact that library design involves many non-canonical choices? If it’s not good enough yet, what are the key obstacles? And if people are doing this already, what projects exist and how good are they?</p>",

In short, autoformalisation is decent at proving theorems (but these proofs are still much longer than mathlib-level proofs, often not in the right generality, etc.), but it's very unclear if it can be useful for formalising definitions. The bottleneck with formalising a lot of mathematics are definitions, and these need human review and experimentation.</p>",
