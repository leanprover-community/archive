However, when I use the inbuilt function list.maximum, I get 'some \\N' and not just a natural number. What is the intuition behind that? And also, as the list is immutable, I cannot modify the original list, so I have to get a new list, which I am not comfortable with. What to do in this case? I want to use this as a starting point for constructing heap data structure in Lean.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"import\"><pre><span></span><code>import data.list.basic\n\ndef convert_to_nat (value : option ℕ) : ℕ :=\n  match value with\n  | none := 0\n  | some n := n\n  end\n\n-- Example usage\ndef my_value : option ℕ := some 42\ndef res := convert_to_nat my_value\n\ndef my_list: list ℕ := [4,3,2,1]\ndef val:= my_list.maximum\ndef maxv:= convert_to_nat val\ndef maxind:= my_list.index_of maxv\ndef list2:= my_list.remove_nth maxind\n#reduce list2```\n</code></pre></div>",
