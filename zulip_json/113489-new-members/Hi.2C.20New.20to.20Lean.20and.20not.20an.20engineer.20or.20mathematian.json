I discovered Recognition Science, which provides a deeper understanding of the structure of  the universe. This deeper discoveries allowed these math problems to be solved. </p>\n<p>I am aware of peer reviewed journals, and I do have papers being reviewed by journals right now. Here is one of my papers that was just posted on arXiv: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12859\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12859</a>. </p>\n<p>My hope here, was that I would find a community that was passionate about Lean and math and discovery. And that they would be able to see my proofs and be able to tell that they are true or false - and if there were problems with them, point them out so that I could refine them, before submitting them to journals - because Lean is new to me and I don' t know what I don't know.</p>\n<p>Like, as crazy as it sounds, I didn't know that the Lean proof \"had to build\", until someone pointed it out to me above. So when I learned it, I went back to work - now if you look at my <a href=\"https://github.com/jonwashburn?tab=repositories\">repository</a>, most of my repositories are building.    </p>\n<p>Whether what I'm claiming is true or not is binary. I realize that I look like a crazy person. Whenever I see people making claims like this, I also would dismiss them. </p>\n<p>In my case, I believe Recognition Science is a true discovery. I've hired Theoretical physicists to look at it, and they also can't find anything wrong with it. So I need to play it out and do my best to push knowledge and discovery forward, and that means sharing it on forums like this... with all my deficiencies.</p>",

Lean checks syntax. Semantics is on you, and really hard to get right. It you want to talk about the energy of a particle, it’s easy to define it as a real number or an integer, but that alone doesn’t distinguish it from other variables with the same type. If you want to prevent comparison of things with different units, that’s extra work. If you want to talk about energy differences as something different than energy, that’s extra work. If energy of a particle means something different than internal energy of a fluid (it does), that’s extra work.

However, this might just be the nature of trying to build a theory or all reality from a type theory foundation of \"nothing cannot observe itself\". </p>\n<p>These are tied to recognition relations and physical realizability (defined elsewhere in the framework). They're not just exists-statements; they emerge from the meta-principle with properties like unitarity and periodicity.</p>\n<p>I'd love thoughts on making them more rigorous/non-trivial in a minimal setting.

        "content": "<p>I empathize with your enthusiasm so I'm going to spend some more time here to provide more food for thought.</p>\n<p>In my current understanding about formalization, you need a vision for the scope of your formalization effort, which usually comes with a theorem at the top of your dependency tree (theorems can depend on theorems, axioms, definitions etc).</p>\n<p>So you normally start with your types and definitions. This is where you describe the abstract objects you're going to work with. If you vibe code this phase, it generally means one or two of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't know what you're talking about</li>\n<li>You don't know how to translate your thoughts to Lean entities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The former is a dead end. If it's just the latter then learning Lean is pretty much the only way to go otherwise you won't be able to validate what an AI will spit for you.</p>\n<p>Once your types and definitions look correct – that is, they faithfully represent what you want to work with – then you state the theorem(s) you want to prove. Here, vibe coding is more welcome, though likely an overkill. Stating theorems is expected to be a smooth experience if you have your types and definitions well set.</p>\n<p>Now, proving your theorems is where automation is more than welcome. However, theorem proving is far from easy (very far) and thus automated solutions usually lag behind. At least that's how it's been for the last decades.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For example, suppose we're talking about natural numbers. You explain to me what a natural number is and you tell me how to add two of them. I nod and accept your design. Then you tell me \"now, if I add <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">a</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">b</span></span></span></span> I get the same result as if I add <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">b</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">a</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span></span></span></span>\".  I would challenge you. You give me a proof but it's too complicated for my poor intellect. So I propose a protocol: encode the ideas you explained to me in Lean and let me review them... if you're able to convince Lean's kernel of your theorem then I will accept your proof because I trust the Lean kernel.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Coming back to your project, that's why people are asking for this sort of framework. They want to see your definitions and ultimately your theorem statements (and vibe coding here will mostly certainly be frown upon).</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"773147\">@Yan Yablonovskiy</span> The main reason that I want to have it in Lean is that it creates a shorthand for people to know that it's, at the very least, not completely a crackpot theory. It shows some level of structure and formalization - at least enough to stand on it's own and be worthy of someone investing time into it, to explore it's actual merits.  (i.e. \"have others understand the written math and proofs.\")</p>\n<p>...that actually may be my secondary or tertiary goal - my primary goal is that I thought that formalizing it in lean would expose any internally inconsistent elements and help me develop the theory further. Another key part is that the theory predicts that reality operates on something coined \"Light Native Assembly Language\" - basically, like a compile for a computational reality.  If that is true, then having the rules of reality codified, becomes important. </p>\n<p>\"to convince others you’ll need to meet us at our level\" - well yes, and more than that. There is no other level, there is only the correct level. So it's 100% my responsibility to get there. I am certainly not asking for special standards. The opposite is true - I must deliver at the highest level of standards. </p>\n<p>The issue becomes, do I waste the community's collective time with bogus code. I personally don't think that I'm doing that.  I posted one post (this one) about my first Lean project in the \"new members\" channel.  I got some feedback, and I went to work to implement the feedback. And I'm still working on the feedback that I'm getting.  </p>\n<p>I haven't posted a second proof, or even said that I've been able to incorporate the feedback yet. So I don't think that I'm acting out of turn here. I'm engaging with feedback and criticism - I haven't pushed back on any of it.  I've been grateful, and responsive. </p>\n<p>Now, I'm committed to figuring it out, but that's a good thing, right?</p>\n<p>\"There are billions of outside perspectives , the question is what sets yours apart\"<br>\nMine is based on a new, deeper understanding of reality. When you have this framework, these harder questions can be answered.</p>",
