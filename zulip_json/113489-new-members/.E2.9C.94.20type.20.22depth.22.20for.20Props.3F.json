I got a good answer from claude about why Props have to diverge from the rest of the types (impredicability, proof invariance), but not why can't I expect that if we start with <code>3</code> and <code>rfl</code> as basic building blocks the same number of questions \"what is this type of\" don't end up in the same object, i.e. why isn't <code>Prop: Type 1</code>?</p>",

This reflects the fact that in ZFC, Cardinal numbers are a proper class.</p>\n<p>As for why we don't have <code>Prop : Type 1</code>, this is so that the universes can be nicely ordered. Remember that <code>Prop</code> is an abbreviation for <code>Sort 0</code>, and <code>Type u</code> is an abbreviation for <code>Sort (u + 1)</code>. Having <code>Sort 0 : Sort 2</code> would just be weird.</p>",

Thinking about three layered hierarchy - terms, types, universes (with some <code>type of</code> relations between universes), seems to be the right way to do it, and not something I expected when I asked the question.</p>\n<p>Funny enough, I used to teach TypeScript courses to software engineers, and they will often get throw off by the value (term in FP and Lean) vs type difference, especially with TS's fancier type system that has singleton types like <code>let x: 3 = 3</code>. But when your types don't have types, things are simpler :) We will tell people just to look syntactically are you in a type-position, i.e. after the : or not.</p>",
