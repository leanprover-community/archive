I work on stochastic methods for global optimization and sampling methods. I am currently trying to adapt proofs I wrote concerning the convergence of a such method in Lean 4 (and Mathlib obviously).  I was introduced to Lean by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> 5 years ago in a course, and I'm starting to get back into it. I'm looking forward to being part of the Lean community, as I find very important the problem of formalization and reproducibility of mathematical proofs.<br>\nBy the way, is there a tool to render Lean 4 projects in HTML (as <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/format_lean\">format-lean</a>)? Thank you very much!</p>",
