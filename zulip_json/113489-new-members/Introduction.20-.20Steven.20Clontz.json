My academic/research background is in general and set-theoretic topology, and I have a previous life as co-owner/operator of a tiny (now defunct) SaaS startup. These days my professional interests are steering towards cyberinfastructure for mathematics and STEM education research and practice, see <a href=\"https://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/cyberinfrastructure/\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://tbil.org/\">that</a> and <a href=\"https://topology.pi-base.org/\">another thing</a> for a couple relevant projects I'm involved with. </p>\n<p>My spring sabbatical in part aims to finally dig into formalized mathematics. I just beat the natural number game over the past day or so - is there a call to action for where I should start exploring next?</p>",
