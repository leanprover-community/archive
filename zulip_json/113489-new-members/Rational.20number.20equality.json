Mathlib prefers to use <code>*</code> over explicit <code>rat.mul</code>, also many lemmas are stated in this way too.<br>\nThe reason people quickly switch to tactics is that the term mode proofs very quickly become painful, especially for this sort of thing, the first few chapters of  <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/\">#tpil</a> are quite term-mode-y though I think.<br>\nWhat specific proof do you have in mind to formalize this example, on paper, in detail? You'll probably want to state some general lemmas and then combine those to prove your example</p>",
