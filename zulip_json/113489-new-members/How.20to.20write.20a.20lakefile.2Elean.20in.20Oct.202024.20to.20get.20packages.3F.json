I edited some code and realized I wanted some hashmap function that I think is in <code>Lean.Data.HashMap</code>. I believe I need to put a require line into my <code>lakefile.lean</code>, but on reaching this point I realize I don't really know how to add requirements incrementally as I need them to my lakefile. I also find a <code>require from</code> syntax and a <code>require /</code> syntax. Can I be pointed to some source for how this is supposed to go?</p>",
