I do not even find QR Decomposition in lean : (</p>\n<p>Problem Statement</p>\n<p>Given a function f: Mₙ(ℂ) → Mₙ(ℂ) that maps each invertible complex square matrix A to its unique QR decomposition (Q, R), where:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A = QR</li>\n<li>Q is unitary (i.e., Q*Q = I)</li>\n<li>R is upper triangular with positive real diagonal elements</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We need to prove that this function f preserves multiplication, i.e., for any two invertible matrices A and B in Mₙ(ℂ):<br>\nf(AB) = f(A)f(B)</p>\n<p>Proof Approach</p>\n<p>To prove that f preserves multiplication, we need to show that the QR decomposition of AB equals the QR decomposition of the product of their respective QR decompositions. Here are the detailed steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let A = Qᴬ Rᴬ and B = Qᴮ Rᴮ be the QR decompositions of A and B respectively</li>\n<li>Then AB = Qᴬ Rᴬ Qᴮ Rᴮ</li>\n<li>Let C = Rᴬ Qᴮ, which is invertible (since both Rᴬ and Qᴮ are invertible)</li>\n<li>Perform QR decomposition on C: C = Qᶜ Rᶜ</li>\n<li>Therefore AB = Qᴬ Qᶜ Rᶜ Rᴮ</li>\n<li>Note that Qᴬ Qᶜ is a product of unitary matrices, hence still unitary</li>\n<li>Rᶜ Rᴮ is a product of upper triangular matrices, hence still upper triangular with positive real diagonal elements (since both Rᶜ and Rᴮ have positive real diagonal elements)</li>\n<li>By the uniqueness of QR decomposition, this must be the QR decomposition of AB</li>\n<li>Therefore f(AB) = (Qᴬ Qᶜ, Rᶜ Rᴮ)</li>\n<li>And f(A)f(B) = (Qᴬ, Rᴬ)(Qᴮ, Rᴮ) = (Qᴬ Qᶜ, Rᶜ Rᴮ) (because the QR decomposition of Rᴬ Qᴮ is (Qᶜ, Rᶜ))</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus we've proved that f(AB) = f(A)f(B).</p>",
