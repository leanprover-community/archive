My prediction is AI will solve 2-3 of them with proofs that are not understandable by humans. Probably the prize money will go to Google.</p>\n<p>Social Credit Score<br>\n================<br>\nEach mathematician will be assigned a social credit score calculated algorithmically by the AI based on proofs they have submitted. The algorithm will consider how their theorems have been used in other theorems. Of course this will be abused by some  teams by repeatedly citing their own theorems. And there will be a massive scandal. Ultimately leading to all human mathematicians being banned.</p>",

Given the 5 year time period I don't think most mathematicians would enjoy formalization as part of their research. I really think by then AGI will be clever enough to deal with mathematicians normal language and be able to translate it to lean without issue.</p>\n<p>There will be some people working symbiotically with Lean to create proofs. But my belief is that the proof checking will likely be something in the background just done as a consistency check.

It would be unlikely that they would first learn Chinese, rather they would translate it with the LLM.</p>",
