I have been using lean recreationally for some time, but since I’m starting a more “serious” project, i felt like joining this chat to ask questions about best practices and whatnot! </p>\n<p>i am in the process of formalizing a few recent results in computer science/topology, so my focus as of right now is understanding how mathlib works, in hopes of maybe contributing some of my work in the future! i’m very excited with regards to where this project will go in the future and i’d love to be able to be part of it.</p>",
