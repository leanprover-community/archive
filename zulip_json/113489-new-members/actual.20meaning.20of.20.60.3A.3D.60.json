In order from most to least transparent, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reducible</li>\n<li>reducible and instances</li>\n<li>default</li>\n<li>irreducible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that when you write <code>abbrev S := P</code>, this means <code>S := P</code> at <em>reducible</em> transparency (this is the technical sense of abbreviation that I mentioned above). You can also write <code>irreducible_def S := P</code> to get a definition at irreducible transparency.</p>",
