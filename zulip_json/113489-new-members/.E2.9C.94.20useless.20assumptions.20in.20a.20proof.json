I was  wondering why Lean doesn't allow me to make assumptions which are not at all helpful or useful for the proof. I.e., why do I get the \"failed to unify\" error when trying to <code>assume hpq : p  ∧ q</code>. Is there another way of introducing statements like these in your proofs ? </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
