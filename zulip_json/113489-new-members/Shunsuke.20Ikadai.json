Starting next year, I will be a Master's student in Computer Science. My main interests are mathematical logic, specifically proof theory and non-classical logic, and its application.</p>\n<p>I discovered Lean while researching automated theorem proving and started using it recently. So far, I have read roughly up to Chapter 5 of \"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\" and have also played the Natural Number Game, and then have started to understand how to use Lean just a little.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I would like to contribute to the formalization of logic in Lean.<br>\nThrough this community, I also want to get used to communicating in English.</p>\n<p>Nice to meet you!</p>",
