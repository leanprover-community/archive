I figured I should port the code to VS Code since future projects will be done in that editor in the first place, so I downloaded the resources at (<a href=\"https://lovettsoftware.com/NaturalNumbers/TutorialWorld/Level1.lean.html\">https://lovettsoftware.com/NaturalNumbers/TutorialWorld/Level1.lean.html</a>), the offline lean4 version.</p>\n<p>The code with which I solved the online puzzle did not work for the offline version though. My working proof for level 6 in the additionworld (online version) was:</p>\n<p>lemma add_right_comm (a b c : MyNat) : a + b + c = a + c + b := by<br>\n  induction c with d hd<br>\n  rw [add_zero]<br>\n  rw [add_zero]<br>\n  rfl<br>\n  rw [add_succ]<br>\n  rw [add_succ]<br>\n  rw [succ_add]<br>\n  rw [hd]<br>\n  rfl</p>\n<p>for the offline version I needed to change it to</p>\n<p>lemma add_right_comm (a b c : MyNat) : a + b + c = a + c + b := by<br>\n  induction' c with d hd<br>\n  rw [zero_is_0]<br>\n  rw [add_zero]<br>\n  rw [add_zero]<br>\n  rw [add_succ]<br>\n  rw [add_succ]<br>\n  rw [succ_add]<br>\n  rw [hd]</p>\n<p>specifically the induction I did online stopped working and the rw added an automatic rfl functionality.</p>\n<p>Not sure if this is intended, as you can probably tell I am quite new to this :)</p>\n<p>Have a nice weekend<br>\nbernobin</p>",

Note that <code>main</code> has moved on quite a lot since the last time the game was deployed to the web and that it will be soon moving again, so you might not see the same levels, but you will certainly see the same behaviour of <code>rfl</code> and <code>induction</code> (because they are redefined in <code>NNG4</code> for pedagogical reasons).</p>",
