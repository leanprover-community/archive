Previously I did a PhD where I tried to design better graphical user interfaces for proof assistants, taking inspiration from recent developments in <a href=\"http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/\">deep inference</a> proof theory. I know some folks here have done great work on GUIs, e.g. <br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/ProofWidgets4/tree/main\">ProofWidgets</a> for interacting with goals and <a href=\"https://github.com/Paper-Proof/paperproof\">Paperproof</a> for visualizing proofs. I would definitely be excited to collaborate on these subjects in the future <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span> </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now I have just started learning both topos theory and Lean 4, with the goal of formalizing the former into the latter (joint project with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"125073\">@Anthony Bordg</span>, see <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"113489\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Topoi.20in.20Mathlib\">#new members &gt; Topoi in Mathlib</a>). I am currently going through the first chapter of the classic <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0927-0\">Sheaves in Geometry and Logic</a>, and would like to do some hands-on practice by formalizing basic notions and results in Lean. In particular, <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Topoi.20in.20Mathlib/near/451359125\">it has been suggested</a> by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243562\">@Adam Topaz</span> that subobject classifiers are an easy target for formalization that have not made their way to <code>mathlib</code> yet.</p>\n<p>Thus I was wondering if I could obtain write access to non-<code>master</code> branches to start working on subobject classifiers? I would basically implement definitions and theorems from Sheaves in Geometry and Logic in a module <code>Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Subobject.Classifier</code>.</p>",
