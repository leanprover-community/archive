I worked on developing a new compression and encryption algorithm. I wasn't trying to be dishonest. I just wished to start a nice conversation. The mathematical theory I developed is non-standard, I am available for discussing it but I was aiming to see if there was an interested in trying my algorithm. Any approach or interest you might suggest is welcome. Thank you again and I apologize one more time. Pleasure to be new member of this community. I have prepared a SaaS architecture very simple to implement it, I've been working on this over the past 2 years. I can really achieve higher compression and encryption and current standards, but is not just promoting. I benchmarked many times, I know it sounds hard to believe.</p>",
