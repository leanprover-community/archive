I am an undergraduate mathematics student at the University of Cambridge, and trying to become familiar with Lean 4.<br>\nI am looking to formalise more machinery for some of my work in analytic number theory, and a key ingredient, namely the Euler-Maclaurin formula, does not appear to be in Mathlib4. All the machinery to formally prove it seems to already exist, so I was wondering if this would be a good project to work on and contribute to Mathlib4?<br>\nIt would also provide a short, immediate proof of Faulhaber's formula <code>sum_range_pow</code> as a corollary.</p>",
