It seems to me to be a great fit in theory, because I have a background in software, and I think the graph like structure of these libraries has an advantage over the liner presentation you usually find in textbooks. However outside some of the books that cover the basics, I could not find much exercise material. Is there any exercise material that covers more advanced topics in MathLib for example? Maybe even a tool that auto generates them from the sources?</p>",
