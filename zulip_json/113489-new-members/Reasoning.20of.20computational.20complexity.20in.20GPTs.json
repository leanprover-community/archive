Formalization means to express mathematical concepts, definitions, theorems, and proofs in a way that can be checked by a computer for correctness. Lean theorem prover is interactive and based on dependent type theory which is a powerful and expressive framework for formalizing computer science. It has been used for example in formalization of number theory. Similarly, it can be used to formalize the notion of computational complexity of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). Some of the relevant computational complexity classes are BGP (=AWPP), BQP, BPP, PP, PSPACE. We can formalize the notions of these computational complexity classes and the relations among them in lean. We can also move further on to formalize the notion of higher order interference in physical theories and formalize some theorems related to it. The exact problem is to write relevant lean module(s) containing the basic definitions, results in GPTs and tools for reasoning about computational complexity in GPTs. The developed module can further be used to give formal proofs for theorems and lemmas.</p>\n<p>Organization: Ministry of Defence</p>\n</blockquote>",

You could try writing a domain specific language for making it easy to write Turing machines that then compiles into a suitable data structure internally.
