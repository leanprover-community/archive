I used Lean for several months in 2023/2024, then stopped, and I am returning now - and the interface of the Emacs mode has changed... the first screenshot below shows the old interface, that was much better for the things that I wanted to do, and the second screenshot shows how things are now.</p>\n<p>The new interface shows the current result - <code>(Arith.var \"x\").mul (Arith.nat 20) : Arith</code> in the screenshot - right justified in the program window, probably using an overlay, and shows only its first line; the old interface showed it in the echo area, and showed multi-line outputs, like trees, correctly.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to tell the Emacs mode to show the current result in the echo area instead of showing it as an overlay? How? I couldn't find it, sorry... hints, please?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/eqRlL9hhAJb1CMfxnuYF0q4v/2024-LuaTreeLean-1.png\">2024-LuaTreeLean-1.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/52kgF7QcaWnM1WNFhCfEtUMp/sshot.png\">sshot.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/eqRlL9hhAJb1CMfxnuYF0q4v/2024-LuaTreeLean-1.png\" title=\"2024-LuaTreeLean-1.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1280x800\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/eqRlL9hhAJb1CMfxnuYF0q4v/2024-LuaTreeLean-1.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/52kgF7QcaWnM1WNFhCfEtUMp/sshot.png\" title=\"sshot.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1280x800\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/52kgF7QcaWnM1WNFhCfEtUMp/sshot.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
