Are you looking for (1) cutting edge research, (2) Lean specific user tools, or (3) something you can plug into an existing VS Code Copilot plugin/fork (like Continue or Cursor)?  For (1) there is a lot of research.  See <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"219941\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving\">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving</a>.  For (2), try out <a href=\"https://github.com/cmu-l3/llmlean\">https://github.com/cmu-l3/llmlean</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanCopilot\">https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanCopilot</a> and let us and the maintainers (respectively <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"409334\">@Sean Welleck</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"584504\">@Kaiyu Yang</span>) know your thoughts.  For (3), the standard LLMs make a lot of mistakes with Lean (including mixing up Lean 3 and Lean 4 syntax), so your mileage may vary, but for example, recently <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Kim Morrison</span> thought that Cursor (which I think uses Sonnet 3.5) was pretty good for some Lean tasks (<a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"113488\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cursor.20.28VSCode.20variant.20with.20AI.20better.20than.20Github.20Copilot.29\">#general &gt; cursor (VSCode variant with AI better than Github Copilot)</a>).</p>",
