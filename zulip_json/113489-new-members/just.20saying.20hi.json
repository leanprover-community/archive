I've been working on formalizing quantum mechanics in Lean 4, specifically handling unbounded operators properly (Robertson uncertainty, Stone's theorem, spectral theory). I think this makes Lean the first theorem prover where you can actually do real QM, not just finite-dimensional toy models.</p>\n<p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/adambornemann-glitch/LogosLibrary\">https://github.com/adambornemann-glitch/LogosLibrary</a></p>\n<p>I'm currently working on Cayley transform before I move on to functional calculus for spectral theory.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any scrutiny you can offer.</p>",
