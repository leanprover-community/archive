I'm afraid for this parragraph and if someone interested to help me, I appreciated.</p>\n<p>I've studied mathetics since May  and I'm going class in Fall semester. I'll have a curse on elemental geometry and I've been preparing. The question is How do I know my prove is right and How do I know what are the neccesary steps to prove something? <br>\nSomething else, I started to read Elemenatry geometry for coleggue students to refresh my mind and now I'm reading foundations of geometry in hilbert  to then read about elementary taski's geometry to final read Euclides. I know thats not the order but I want the most rigorous in question but I'm not sure of my election, what is your advice?</p>",
