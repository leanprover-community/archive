        "content": "<p>Hello—I’m Paul. I’m a practicing cardiologist (affilated with NYU) based in Brooklyn, NY, but my nights are dedicated to a second life as an independent researcher in mathematical foundations. My project is Axiom Calibration (AxCal), a framework I am formalizing in Lean 4 to measure the logical strength of classical theorems.</p>\n<p>My clinical background includes applied AI, and I initially hoped LLMs could accelerate my return to the math I set aside as a teenager. After being repeatedly burned by hallucinations, I now use Lean to ground every claim and, in a sense, to make the AI prove its work.</p>\n<p>The initial spark for this came from functional analysis. Thinking of functionals as “measuring devices” and the bidual as a “mirror,” I focused on the persistent gap in infinite dimensions where a space fails to be reflexive—that is, where the canonical embedding into its bidual space is not surjective. I initially suspected Gödel-style limits were at play, but the answer only became clear through formalization. The rigor demanded by Lean 4 was the tool that allowed me to narrow the phenomenon down, showing the trail led not to incompleteness, but consistently to the Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience (WLPO).</p>\n<p>I am not a professional mathematician and am actively seeking mentorship, code review, and direction. If this program is misguided, I would be grateful to hear it plainly now rather than wander for years. If there’s promise, I’m happy to do the unglamorous work of a trainee and keep buying the coffee.</p>\n<p>My repository, with papers and the Lean builds, is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/AICardiologist/FoundationRelativity\">https://github.com/AICardiologist/FoundationRelativity</a></p>",

LLM can lie and create a seemingly correct proof that is hard to catch (hidden sorrys, sub-files that hide illegal shortcuts.   I ended up using multiple agents where Gemini Deep Think serves as the architect to design the proof architecture and chief math consultant (senior math consultant agent);  a GPT-5 Pro agent for crafting Lean codes and framework; and then Claude Code to be in charge of repo management and execution only.  If the junior professor GPT-5-Pro agent fails, it will decide whether to ask Gemini Deep Think, who only provides mathematical support and Lean code snippets. A separate agent is responsible for auditing the proof.   </p>\n<p>It is because I am not an expert and \"not in the loop\", and quite frankly, every time I have reached out to math professors, I have been ignored. Therefore, I present my work here so that someone with actual expertise can assist me.  Perhaps my proofs are all wrong, but any comments, especially criticism, help me make my work less wrong, which hopefully can benefit someone in future.</p>",

The claim \"We do NOT open classical or use by_cases here\" is flat-out wrong; the file opens Classical globally and uses classical, by_contra, and by_cases throughout. This is a documentation slip-up (likely from an LLM scaffold that didn't match the proof needs), not a flaw in the math itself, but it definitely erodes trust in the artifact. We'll update the comment ASAP to reflect reality.</p>\n<p>To clarify the context: This file implements the forward direction (bidual gap ⇒ WLPO) using Ishihara's kernel technique, which is standard in constructive reverse math (CRM). In CRM, we use classical meta-logic to analyze implications over a constructive base like BISH—the object logic stays intuitionistic, but the proofs of equivalences (like this one) rely on classical tools for case-splits on undecidable props (e.g., \"is α all-false?\"). The kernel's g α def explicitly cases on that, which requires LEM in the meta-level, as noted in the paper's Section 2.2/ Remark 2.5. So the code is doing exactly what it should for CRM, but the \"Constructive/\" folder name and comment set false expectations.</p>\n<p>@Weiyi Wang: Great question on by_cases—nothing's inherently wrong with it! In constructive settings, it's fine (and computable) if the prop is decidable (e.g., n = 0 for n : ℕ). But here, it's used on undecidable stuff like x = 0 in normed spaces or the all-false sequence, so it invokes Classical.em under the hood (enabled by open Classical). That's the classical usage we need for the meta-reasoning.</p>\n<p>Thank you both for going over my work. <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span></p>",

Furthermore, Claude Code can do illegal shortcuts.  Goedel Prover v2 did not seem to work well: but perhaps a one-shot solution is suboptimal.  My Python codes for cardiology use case have always been iterative over a long period of time as we look for edge cases.     So my naive thinking was: instead of expecting any AI to produce a working code on one go, it has to be iterative, with different agents, ideally from different LLMs to take advantage of their individual strengths.  I noticed GPT-5-Pro has long memory and context, and can handle Lean 5 codes on a tactical level. However GPT-5-pro seems to have problem with coming up with proper architecure and strategies when the answer is not clear. In contrast, Deep Think Gemini seems to be very good with strategies and designing a framework, but may not get the Lean code to compile.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of their individual strength and weakness, I have gotten my Lean codes to compile, to kind of work, at least for a Lean novice.  GPT-Pro-5 even told me to bring my repo to this forum to get real feedback in case we have any blind spots (which were many).</p>\n<p>To Lean expert, what I am doing may be blasphemous.  But I get to experience the joy of Lean.  And I appreciate all feedbacks.  (actually I was more worried about people ignoring me than people flaming me with large torches.)</p>\n<p>In my own field (medicine), we encountered the same issue with multiple AI agent collaboration: an expert needs to oversee the final output.  However, it was clear to me in medicine that the use of AI definitely augmented the clinician's ability.</p>",

In particular, there is benchmarking for regressions and compile time, CI, linters, etc. Simp lemmas are carefully controlled, and proofs that go into mathlib are written in a way that makes them less likely to break as the rest of the code changes (so things like non-terminal simps are discouraged).</p>\n<p>The sorry explosion can easily arise from non-judicious use of LLMs, because they tend to make a lot of statements that are almost correct but are actually wrong, and if you try to get the LLM to fill those in there's nothing it can do except add more lemmas with sorries. Probably the best idea would be to be really careful about what definitions and theorem statements you have and that should avoid a lot of sorry explosion.</p>",

Keep in mind, that there's a difference between a development version and a release.</p>\n<p><code>sorry</code> is like <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.todo.html\"><code>todo!()</code></a>: when you start doing something there going to be a lot of them, but in the release version there should be none. And the length of iteration depends on how good your intuition is: mathematicians are pretty good at stating true things so they can afford delaying filling <code>sorry</code>ies for rather long time. Your intuition (and mine as well, since I'm not a professional mathematician) is less solid, so iterations should be shorter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>since I use LLM</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, the problem is not usage of LLM <em>per se.</em> It's the matter of understanding. Though, there's one problem with LLMs: when you understand how to do something, you don't need them too much since you can easily do it yourself. But when you don't understand, you should not use them until you do understand.</p>",
