Why is the new proof so much longer (over 300 lines) and also involves so many other files?  Is it because several variations of the results are also proved?  I also don't quite understand the proof strategy.  I'm no expert in the subject matter.  But it seems to me that <code>Ramsey.exists_monochromatic_infinite_subset</code> is the conceptually simplest among the proved results, because it involves only the concept of cardinality and nothing about ordering.  Shouldn't all other results be derived from it, rather than the other way around?</p>",
