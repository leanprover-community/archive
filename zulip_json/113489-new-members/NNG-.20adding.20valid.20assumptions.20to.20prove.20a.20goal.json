I would like to add the (true) assumption that d ≤ succ d, then use le_trans to prove that succ d_n ≤ d ≤ succ d = succ d_n ≤ succ d, completing the goal. Is there a way to do this in Lean?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/LKCped8qNZiR3mVMbJ__A5vp/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1391x645\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/LKCped8qNZiR3mVMbJ__A5vp/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",

Although to be honest, I don't  understand how. I wanted to add the subgoal d ≤ succ d, but that command doesn't mention succ d. Does it  know to add that because there is d at the end? And why does succ d_n have to be in parentheses?</p>",

You need to provide the value of <code>b</code>, because Lean cannot infer it from your goal.</p>\n<p>Since  your goal is to prove <code>succ d_n ≤ succ d</code>, then <code>a</code> can only be <code>succ d_n</code> and <code>c</code> can only be <code>succ d</code>, but there is no similar way to guess what <code>b</code> should be; so you need to provide the first two parameters and then Lean figures what the remaining ones should be (and can ask for the two intermediate inequalities, which become new goals).</p>",

However if you write <code>exact h1</code> at this step it can then infer <code>b</code>. I left this out of my original answer since its a little more advanced.</p>",
