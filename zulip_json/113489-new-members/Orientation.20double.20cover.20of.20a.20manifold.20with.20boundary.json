I have been teaching myself topology and working on a proving the central theorem of portal science: surface independence. Here is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SqYjYLT_yWm8afTKx9RmSxRz5jcswJ-7YT8cd6Sl04Q/edit?usp=sharing\">my work</a>. As you can see, it is nowhere near formal enough for a lean proof yet, but i hope to get there soon. One important part of my construction is that I am \"cutting\" a topological manifold in a way that seems to be different from the standard approach: i remove the submanifold and replace it with the orientation double cover as new \"edges\". Also, i have never seen a definition of odc that works with a manifold with boundary, but i have heard that its not a big issue. Dealing with boundary is important for the case of a portal going through itself. I could not find anything about odc in the lean library. Has anyone worked on that yet?</p>",
