I'm wondering what to do once I've finished these.</p>\n<p>I'm certainly planning to look at Metaprogramming in Lean 4 eventually, but I'm not sure if I'll dive into it right away as I'm growing thirsty for math to formalize. But first, I'd like to see some high-quality code to learn how experts structure and write their proofs and programs.</p>\n<p>Where should I look specifically? Should I first look at parts of the implementation of Batteries, Lean itself or even Mathlib, using the documentation as a reference? Or is there perhaps another project I might not know about that would be better to study first?</p>",
