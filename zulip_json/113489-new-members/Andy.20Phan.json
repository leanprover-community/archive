I'm a software engineer/competitive programmer who recently discovered Lean, and honestly this is one of the coolest projects I've seen!</p>\n<p>After getting some exposure to type theory through Agda and HoTT, I've been constantly thinking about how awesome it would be to have a general-purpose programming language with a proof-enabling type system (especially for some challenging competitive programming problems), so seeing that this exists is very exciting!</p>\n<p>I'm excited to learn more about Lean, as well as watching as how it grows and evolves over time!</p>",
