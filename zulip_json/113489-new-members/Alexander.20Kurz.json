Again, i'd be interested if somebody used LLMs for teaching Lean, in particular to computer science undergrads.</p>",

I taught myself several languages I did have zero experience in. So in principle proof assistants should be in scope. Currently I am experimenting with Isabelle, Lean and Idris. And I was wondering whether somebody here has some experience with this approach to teaching and learning.</p>",
