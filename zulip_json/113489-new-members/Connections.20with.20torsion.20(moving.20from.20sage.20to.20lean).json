I am currently trying to write an example of an Ehresmann connection on a principal bundle and find myself frustrated by sage's lack of types. How feasible would it be to \"port\" my Mercator example to Lean? I can give more details of my sage implementation if that would help (in summary I have a 2-sphere with the usual metric but with a connection in which straight lines on the mercator projection are really straight lines - this respects the metric but clearly is <em>not</em> the Levi-Civita connection which has great circles as straight lines - the straight lines with the Mercator connection are called loxodromes).</p>",
