You can bundle this into a continuous linear map. You can show it is in fact an isometry for <code>RCLike 𝕜</code>. So you can build a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=LinearIsometry#doc\">docs#LinearIsometry</a> (with notation <code>→ₗᵢ[𝕜]</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally, you need to show this is surjective, which is the hardest part. Here I would try to look for some proofs on paper and then ask to see which is the easiest to formalize. It would be possible to construct a measure and then go via the Radon-Nikodym derivative, but I'm not sure that's the easiest way.</p>",
