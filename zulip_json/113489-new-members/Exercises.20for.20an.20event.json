I promised them to explain how to formalize set theory theorems and their proofs on lean4. On this Wednesday I will demonstrate Set Theory Game and solve some of the tasks there. On Friday I want to solve some set theory exercises using zulip chat and zulip's lean windows. The students already have necessary links to register in zulip and play the game. I asked them not to post unnecessary messages on zulip. This will be the first such event in Azerbaijan. I hope that it will be useful for them.</p>",
