The levels are well designed and explanations are sufficient to understand the material but not spoil the solutions.</p>\n<p>A few questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I noticed in Proposition World, many of the levels are very similar to Function world. I assume this is to instill the \"moral\" that propositions and functions can be thought of as similar? Level 7 proposition world still says \"Function world\" though, and there are few more typos. Should I submit a PR for these, or is this intended?</li>\n<li>I'm not much of a mathematician but I can probably help out on the more programming aspects, are the issues in <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/issues\">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/issues</a> good to start with if I wanted to help out?</li>\n<li>I'm a little fuzzy on the concept of \"fixed\" variables (as introduced in Adv Mult 4/4). If there's a declaration <code>a: mynat</code>, does that mean <code>a</code> is fixed in this context? If I'm doing an induction (for example) on <code>b</code> in <code>a+b&gt;a</code> and my inductive hypothesis ends up being <code>a+k&gt;a</code>, are both <code>a</code> and <code>k</code> the same \"kinds\" of variables in this context? Fixed? It seems a bit weird because I should be able to substitute anything I want for <code>a</code> in the inductive hypothesis and still have the proof be correct, but of course I cannot substitute <code>succ k</code> for <code>k</code>. Are there other kinds of variables? For example, in <code>\\exists z.z \\geq 0</code>, is z thought of as \"fixed\"?</li>\n</ul>",

I did it like that because at the time I was convinced that mathematicians would better understand intro and apply in the context of functions and I thought that this was quite an amusing way to teach it. Since then I've discovered that mathematicians are just fine with the whole intro apply thing applied directly to propositions and proofs (see for example workshop 1 of <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/01/24/formalising-mathematics-workshop-1/\">my recent course</a> where I just dive straight in) so if I were to write the game again then probably function world would not be in there.

The goal is fluid, it can change during a proof, and previous goals can be thrown away as the proof moves on. If you want to argue via \"we know this stuff, so we can deduce this, and now we can deduce this, and now this, and now we're done\" then you are constantly adding to the list of hypotheses. If you are instead arguing backwards, saying \"reduce the problem to this, and then to this, and then to this, and now we're done\" then you don't have to keep adding hypotheses to the local context and you can throw away previous goals. So from the point of view of formalisation it's less clutter.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, a proof is a function. What a tactic proof is really doing is building that function in an extremely flexible way, adding in parts of the function in funny places and leaving \"holes\" which become new goals. Thought of in this way, a forwards (\"normal for mathematician\") proof can be thought of as building other functions along the way which you plug into the definition of the function you actually want. Arguing backwards is building the function you actually want directly, by building the \"end part\" of it first (you build a function from A to C by directly plugging in the function from B to C and reducing the question to building the function from A to B -- this is the <code>apply</code> tactic). If instead you want to build the function from A to B first, you can't plug it in directly, you need to give it a new name and then apply it to the input (a term of type A) to get the term of type B which as mathematicians we're trained to think we want to have.</p>",

Even though Lean doesn't have such a type theory, the language constructs some helper functions to solve these things \"automatically\". In your case, this theorem can be solved by calling <code>xnat.noConfusion</code>, a helper function which discriminates terms of a type by its constructors to prove things like your non-equality here \"automatically\" (I've just realised that this was already mentioned before in this thread, oops):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">zero_not_one</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">xnat.succ</span> <span class=\"n\">xnat.zero</span> <span class=\"bp\">≠</span> <span class=\"n\">xnat.zero</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">xnat.noConfusion</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you're interested in going deeper, these helper functions are described in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpgrGU_8CAAxWmTKQEHfoCBYMQFnoECBUQAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.e-pig.org%2Fdownloads%2Fconcon.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw19PtSdJ0cIkOPVRQMxEfqs&amp;opi=89978449\">this</a> paper by McBride, Goguen and McKinna.</p>",
