And so even though I agree with you 100% that I wish Lean was <em>less</em> flexible and therefore had fewer syntactic concepts, I see others find it very useful, and to me it seems simply to be a stylistic choice in language design. But I don't really see it as being very related to the topic here about how to <em>explain</em> what's happening -- meaning once a language does function that way, now you need to describe it, so if you dislike something, it's the functionality you dislike :) the fact that terminology gets more complex is just a byproduct. (I guess I said not to get too deep into meta-land, so probably I should stop doing it, which I'll try to do after this message :D)</p>",
