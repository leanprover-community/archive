In mathlib, it's expressed as a following fact (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/85d5f96e889a9989f88357a1e0c0159e124db61b/Mathlib/Topology/Defs/Basic.lean#L63-L73\">link</a>):<br>\n<code>isOpen_sUnion : ∀ s, (∀ t ∈ s, IsOpen t) → IsOpen (⋃₀ s)</code><br>\nIs there a way to express the same axiom using indexed union instead of unindexed? My attempt is the following:<br>\n<code>isOpen_iUnion : ∀ I: Type, ∀ S: I → Set α, (∀ i, IsOpen (S i)) → IsOpen (⋃ i, S i)</code><br>\nHowever, not every type lies in Type 0. In particular, I can't prove the two axioms are equivalent, since for that I would need <code>I</code> to depend on <code>α</code>, which is of arbitrary type.</p>",
