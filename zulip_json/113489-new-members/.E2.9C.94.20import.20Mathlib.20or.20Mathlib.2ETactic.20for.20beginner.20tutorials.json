To minimise cognitive load I wanted to have the same simple \"import\" at the beginning of the examples, and only change that later when it really becomes necessary.</p>\n<p>Based on the previous discussion I used </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Mathlib</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Tactic</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>as a simple import that brings in most tactics and definitions needed. In 12 tutorials I haven't needed to change this.</p>\n<p>Today I saw a simple example that had:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Mathlib</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Is this now the recommended \"simple starter\" import that brings in the most common definitions and tactics?</p>\n<p>What's changed if this is indeed the case.</p>",

This is my default import for when I'm teaching 1st year undergrad maths in my class, although I move up to <code>import Mathlib</code> when we're doing more nontrivial stuff like 3rd year modules. The disadvantage of <code>import Mathlib</code> is that then there are so many theorems imported that tactics like <code>exact?</code> can take much longer to work. I would experiment with <code>import Mathlib.Tactic</code> but my guess is that this will be fine for you.</p>",
