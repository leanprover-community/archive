It does not give you too much details though.</p>\n<p>The only tutorial I'm aware of which makes a more serious attempt to explain how things work is my own book. For example, when discussing equality, it introduces both <code>Eq.subst</code> and <code>Eq.ndrec</code> (<a href=\"https://suhr.github.io/tmath/basics/lean.html#id4\">https://suhr.github.io/tmath/basics/lean.html#id4</a>). Moreover, it shows how to use them (with explicit motives) to prove basic properties of equality.</p>\n<p>This is already way more than you can find in <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/\">#tpil</a>, but then it shows how you could prove inequality from the first principles.</p>\n<p>The book does not dive into how tactics work though, since it uses only a few of them and the reader already knows how to live without them. But it explains how <code>decide</code> and well-founded recursion work.</p>",

I've tried both the Mechanics of Proof and the Mathematics in Lean tutorials, and I find that they don't do a very good job of explaining the mechanics of using tactics. My approach so far has been to ask (stupid) questions here, and otherwise try to pattern-match from other examples I can find. Are there other tutorials out there that focus less on the math and more on the way to structure proofs in Lean and how to approach using tactics?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"943998\">@JK</span>  I often feel the same way. I think Buzzard's <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2024\">Formalising Mathematics</a> does a better job of explaining tactics.</p>",
