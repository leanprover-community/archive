Often the way you figure out this kind of proof is that you first, on scratch paper, assume that <code>P x</code> is true and then try to deduce from this what <code>x</code> must be.  Sometimes you end up deducing an equation <code>x = a</code>.  The steps in that derivation are what I called (a) above, and <em>those steps do not appear in the proof of <code>∃ x, P x</code></em>.  Rather, to prove <code>∃ x, P x</code> you simply start with <code>use a</code> (no need to explain how you came up with <code>a</code>) and then your goal is to prove <code>P a</code>--this is what I called (b) above.  The proof of <code>P a</code> is often not the same as the steps in (a).  For example, if <code>P x</code> is an equation involving <code>x</code>, then to prove <code>P a</code> you just have to verify that <code>a</code> satisfies the equation (perhaps just by doing some arithmetic), you don't have to solve the equation.</p>\n<p>If you are trying to prove <code>∃! x, P x</code>, rather than <code>∃ x, P x</code>, then, as you described, the second half of the proof is to show that if you have any <code>x</code> such that <code>P x</code>, then you must have <code>x = a</code>.  This is where you can use your reasoning from (a).</p>",

All you have shown is that IF x - 2 = 3 THEN x = 5; you still have to verify the reverse: IF x = 5 THEN x - 2 = 3, which you can do by plugging in 5 and verifying that 5 - 2 = 3.</p>\n<p>In this case, there is another way to verify the second part:  Adding 2 to both sides is reversible: you can subtract 2 from both sides of x = 5 to get x - 2 = 3.  In general, if you use <em>reversible</em> steps when you are solving an equation, then you could think of yourself as proving both directions simultaneously--in this case, both IF x - 2 = 3 THEN x = 5 and also IF x = 5 THEN x - 2 = 3.  The first of these shows that if anything satisfies the equation then it must be 5, and the second shows that 5 does satisfy the equation.  I think this is the source of your confusion: you are assuming that you are going to be using reversible steps when you solve the equation, in which case you're right that you would be simultaneously proving both parts of the exists-unique statement.  But you would have to <em>prove</em> that all of your steps are reversible to have a complete proof.</p>\n<p>The mistake in my \"proof\" that <code>∃! (x : Real), (x ^ 2 + x - 2) / (x ^2 - 1) = 1</code> is that I used a step that was not reversible.  There is nothing wrong with multiplying both sides of the equation by <code>x ^ 2 - 1</code> to get <code>x ^ 2 + x - 2 = x ^ 2 - 1</code>; you can multiply both sides of an equation by 0 if you want to.  However, this step is not reversible.  To reverse it, you would have to divide both sides by <code>x ^ 2 - 1</code>, and that's not allowed if <code>x ^ 2 - 1 = 0</code>.</p>",

But notice that to prove <code>∀ x, P x ↔ x = a</code>, you would probably start with <code>intro x</code>, and then you would have to prove <code>P x ↔ x = a</code>.  Since this is an iff statement, you have to prove both directions.  If you use logical steps to convert <code>P x</code> into <code>x = a</code>, you need to make sure those steps are reversible.</p>",

It might be the case you are thinking \"if i find such an x, and prove any other y for the statement to be true we have y=x\" -- this means youve surely witnessed such an x.</p>\n<p>As others have pointed out, Lean is an implementation of calculus of constructions -- and as such its very flexible; and it is in fact possible in lean to coerce the elaborator to have the second part be true ASSUMING such an x. But it has not been witnessed yet.</p>\n<p>This is also likely a nuance for this stronger version of existence, being that of unique existence.</p>\n<p>Edit: Maybe , in terms of math and ignoring Lean details -- you may think of the second one as proving \"if it exists, it is unique\" rather than \"there exists a unique\". Because number 2 is not saying it exists and its unique, it simply asks whether, given it exists -- is it unique?</p>\n<p>With that in mind, it shouldn't be hard to see why \"if it exists, it is unique\" doesnt guarantee it does exist.</p>",

You're familiar with the fact that an implication is equivalent to its contrapositive?  So that means that if you prove <code>x - 2 = 3 → x = 5</code>, that's equivalent to proving <code>x ≠ 5 → x - 2 ≠ 3</code>.  This says that any number <em>other than</em> 5 is <em>not</em> a solution to the equation.  But it doesn't say that 5 is a solution.  That means that if 5 is a solution then it's the only solution, and if 5 isn't a solution then there are no solutions.  So there is at most one solution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've done wider reading and found two comments that I think are relevant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Note that you can show uniqueness without showing existence.\" (<a href=\"http://Note%20that%20you%20can%20show%20uniqueness%20without%20showing%20existence.\">src</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm having trouble with this. How can a solution be unique but not exist?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's strange wording.  I think what they mean is that you can prove that there is at most one solution without proving that there is at least one solution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If there was a specific solution for x  in the existence part, you do not need to show that y equals that specific x\" (<a href=\"https://nordstrommath.com/IntroProofsText/existunique.html\">src</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to support my original thinking that for simple tasks like \"show there is a unique solution to x-2=3\" it is possible to find a specific solution and we \"do not need to show y, a possible other solution, equals x\".<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, it doesn't.  Suppose you're trying to prove <code>∃! x, P x</code>, and your witness is <code>a</code>.  To prove the existence part, you prove <code>P a</code>.  The Lean strategy you've been learning is that for the uniqueness part, you prove <code>∀ x, P x → x = a</code>.  The web page you linked to suggests an alternative way to prove uniqueness: you can prove <code>∀ x, ∀ y, (P x ∧ P y) → x = y</code>.  They're not saying you can skip the uniqueness part; they're saying that in the proof of the uniqueness part, you can prove that any two solutions must be equal to each other rather than proving than any solution must be equal to your witness <code>a</code>.  They're still saying that you must prove both parts, existence and uniqueness.  (See step 3 under \"Proving Uniqueness\".)</p>\n<p>Here's one more way to look at it:  Another way to say that there is at most one solution is to say that there are not two different solutions, which could be written like this:  <code>¬ ∃ x, ∃ y, P x ∧ P y ∧ x ≠ y</code>.  Now convince yourself that that's equivalent to <code>∀ x, ∀ y, (P x ∧ P y) → x = y</code>.</p>",
