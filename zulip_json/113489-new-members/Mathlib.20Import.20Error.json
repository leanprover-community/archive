When I put <code>import Mathlib.Data.String.Basic</code> at the top of my file, I get a very long and complicated error in the infoview that says that it <a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Q3svbkx8DevEIrwTNq-YcO-b/image.png\">exited with code 1</a>. Does anyone know where to start fixing an error like this? I can provide more information as needed.
