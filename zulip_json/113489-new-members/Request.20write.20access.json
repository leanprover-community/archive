I’m planning to open a PR that adds some Rayleigh quotient lemmas.<br>\nSummary:<br>\n• Prove bounds for the Rayleigh quotient of a vector lying in the span of a finite subfamily of eigenvectors (unit and nonzero / non-normalized versions).<br>\n• Specialize the result to symmetric operators via LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvalues and eigenvectorBasis.</p>\n<p>Could someone with write access help review and merge the PR once it’s up (or grant the necessary write access if appropriate)?<br>\nI’m a new contributor, so any feedback on style, naming, or proof structure would be very appreciated—feel free to suggest changes, or even push a small edit / open a PR on top of mine. Thanks!</p>",
