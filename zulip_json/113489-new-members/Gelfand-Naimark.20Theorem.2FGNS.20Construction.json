Does anyone have thoughts on how feasible formalizing it would be? My current lean experience is mainly just working through the first 3-ish chapters of Mathematics in Lean (though I hope to get through a couple more chapters in the next month or so) and familiarizing myself with the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>C</mi><mo>∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">C^*</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6887em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6887em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mbin mtight\">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>-algebra content already in mathlib.</p>\n<p>I've also noticed that lean generally prefers proving things in as much generality as possible and possibly stating the more familiar theorems as corollaries, so does anybody know if the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinespring_dilation_theorem\">Stinespring dilation theorem</a> is in mathlib or if that would be the preferred way to produce the GNS construction? Because it seems the GNS construction is one of the consequences of that theorem.</p>\n<p>Also, does anybody know what textbook mathlib's <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>C</mi><mo>∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">C^*</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6887em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6887em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mbin mtight\">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>-algebra content is following?
