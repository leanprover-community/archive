Before this, I have never been sure if I have got everything right in my proof and was concerned I missed something. Now with the proof written in Lean, no matter how messy it looks (lol), I know for sure it is correct.</li>\n<li>before proving something, sometimes the math object I described might not be well-defined in the first place, and proving the well-definedness is also important</li>\n</ul>",
