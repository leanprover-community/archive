I returned to it today, and I tried following the instructions from <a href=\"https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html\">here</a>. Unfortunately, When I try the 'install Lean Version Manager' step, the terminal opens, does something, and before I can read anything, it closes.</p>\n<p>In the end, the project that I make does not run. What should I be doing? I'm not even sure about what information I should be informing you guys, at this point, because I don't have an error code from the entire process.</p>",
