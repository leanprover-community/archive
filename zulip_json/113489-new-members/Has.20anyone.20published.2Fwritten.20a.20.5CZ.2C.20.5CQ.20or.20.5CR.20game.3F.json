In fact it might be <em>easier</em> to prove IVT because the supremum argument for sqrt(2) involves having to show that if x^2&lt;2 then there's some epsilon&gt;0 such that (x+epsilon)^2&lt;2 and similarly for &gt;, and these are slightly messy (not impossible, but they need doing, and they don't need doing for IVT, so the route via IVT and showing that polynomials are continuous is conceptually simpler).</p>",
