Something similar to python's <code>dir</code>.</li>\n<li>In emacs, for any operator, such as ▸,  is there a way to look up its definition, similar to using <code>#check</code>?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nRick</p>",

You can try typing <code>MyNamespace.</code> and seeing if autocomplete picks up anything. A more advanced approach is to use the Lean search engine Loogle: <a href=\"https://loogle.lean-fro.org/\">https://loogle.lean-fro.org/</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>In emacs, for any operator, such as ▸,  is there a way to look up its definition, similar to using <code>#check</code>?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The standard go-to-definition command should also work for notation.</p>",
