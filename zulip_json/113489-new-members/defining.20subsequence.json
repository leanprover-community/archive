Of course I can define subsequence to be how it is convenient for my requirements, but I wanted to know how mathlib does it so that I can use related theorems easily. after searching for weierstrass, I found <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/MetricSpace/Sequences.html#tendsto_subseq_of_bounded\">tendsto_subseq_of_bounded</a> which does tell me how to define it, but is there any common place where this is explicitly stated like \"We use subsequences with this definition\"</p>",
