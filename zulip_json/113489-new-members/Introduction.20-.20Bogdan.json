I come from a programming and ML background.<br>\nI've always been envious of the density and brevity of standard math notation, so I expected formal tools to act more like a semantic interface over that logic (for example, interactive demos like <a href=\"http://logitext.mit.edu/tutorial\">http://logitext.mit.edu/tutorial</a>).<br>\nInstead, I found that the workflow in Lean relies heavily on writing tactic scripts in a text editor.<br>\nI'm trying to understand the cognitive workflow here: do you find that this text-based environment eventually becomes a place where you can reason and explore mathematical structures directly, or does most of the reasoning happen on paper, with Lean serving mainly as a tool for formalization and verification?</p>",
