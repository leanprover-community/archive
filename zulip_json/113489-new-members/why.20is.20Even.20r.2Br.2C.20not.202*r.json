I don't know the reason specifically, but I can see less assumptions are better.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, why is <code>Odd</code> not defined as <code>r+r+1</code> which again only uses addition, no multiplication?</p>\n<p>I don't <em>neeed</em> to know the answer, just asking out of interest.</p>",
