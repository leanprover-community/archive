However, for some reason, when I navigate past Infoview window, I press C-w and it gets closed, causing mild frustration.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what's the strategy for fixing this, but I think that us VIM extension users should put our heads together and fix it. Using mouse to navigate is slo-o-o-ow.</p>",
