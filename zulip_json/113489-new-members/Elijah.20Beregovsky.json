I knew about Lean for a while, but only last week I finally got to learning it, and I'm absolutely in love with it already. The NNG was addictive as heck, and as a result lasted me only two days, and now I want more. (I also immediately saw its power as a teaching tool, because it was the first time I got my younger brothers enthusiastic about maths, and not for lack of trying.) <br>\nAt the moment I'm looking at the graph theory part of mathlib and I can't help but notice how many very basic undergrad results are missing from there. I would love to contribute! However, my knowledge of the language and the library is not enough to do that yet, so I'd appreciate some pointers. For example, I can't quite understand how one would write an induction on vertex number<br>\nPS: I also love combinatorial optimisation and integer sequences, so I also want to look into some OEIS-like theorems</p>",

Right now I'm trying (and failing miserably. oh well, learning is a process) to prove a couple very basic tree-related theorems that are not in Acyclic. Specifically I want to prove the converse of IsTree.card_edgeFinset -- if the number of edges in a connected graph is one less than the number of its vertices then the graph is a tree. I want to do that by induction on the vertex number, but I can't figure out how to formalise it. (I also feel like I'd need a lemma like \"a tree has a leaf vertex\" for it, which seems like a useful lemma to have anyway)</p>",
