        "content": "<p>Hey folks! Hope everyone here is doing well. As a quick intro, I finished my undergrad studies at Princeton last May, with specialization in CS, pure math, and ML. Since then, I've been working in SWE and have continued research with Professor Jonathan Hanke on computational number theory. I want to get more involved in research and am looking for mentors who would consider having an external collaborator join a project in the general areas of automated theorem proving, autoformalization, and reasoning with AI.</p>\n<p>My most prominent skill lies in using computational methods and machine learning to solve both theoretical and applied problems. I've also been working hard to catch up with the relevant literature as well as programming in Lean. For more details on my background, you can find my resume <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aJwsYWHvaf8vgjCWbyb249RfULTmNeO_?usp=share_link\">here</a>. Feel free to dm me on Zulip or send an email to <a href=\"mailto:rsaha@alumni.princeton.edu\">rsaha@alumni.princeton.edu</a> for any further questions or to get in touch.</p>",
