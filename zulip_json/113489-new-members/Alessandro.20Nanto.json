        "content": "<p>The problem is that in lean, there is a difference between types equipped with structure (topologies, diffeologies, group structures etc.) and objects of the corresponding categories. For example, a diffeological space is a type <code>X : Type*</code> with a diffeology <code>d : DiffeologicalSpace X</code> registered as an instance - so even though <code>X</code> itself does not contain the diffeology as data, when you have a map <code>f : X → X</code> and write <code>DSmooth f</code> lean finds the instance and knows which diffeology you are talking about. This is handy when talking about spaces like <code>ℝ</code> that carry many structures at once, because it prevents you from having differentiate between \"<code>ℝ</code> the group\", \"<code>ℝ</code> the topological space\", \"<code>ℝ</code> the diffeological space\" and so on.<br>\nIn contrast to that, an object in a category needs to contain all the data belonging to that object - so for example an object in the category <code>DiffSp</code> of diffeological spaces is not simply a type, but instead a structure having both a type and a diffeology on it as fields. You can convert between the two by by coercing <code>X' : DiffSp</code> to a type or using <code>DiffSp.of X</code> to construct an object of <code>DiffSp</code> from a type with a diffeology on it, but those coercions do need to happen and tend to stick around, which is what at least in my experience makes mixing categorical and non-categorical arguments a little cumbersome.</p>",

If I understand correctly (I'm still not too familiar with how this works), the first approach is similar to the idea of a diffeological space as a set, or some \"ground type\", with extra data (the diffeology) attached to it. Then different extra structures can be attached to the same X and recalled by Lean when needed, while with the second approach, X is always a diffeological space.
