I want to formalize the proposition that an element in R[x] ,where R is a commutative ring, is a unit if and only if its contant term is unit in R and all other coefficients are nilpotent in R. I check the leanexplore and didn’t find it. May I pleasely ask that if this result is already in mathlib or not?</p>",
