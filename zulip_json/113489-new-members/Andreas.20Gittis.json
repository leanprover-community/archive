I've just started an automated theorem proving project and I'm going to be trying to use mathlib and Lean 4. I'm relatively new to the language, especially the metaprogramming side. I had a great time with the Theorem Proving in Lean book; thank you to the authors and everyone else who helped put it together. I'm looking forward to learning more about Lean in the coming months; hopefully I do not deluge everyone here with too many bothersome questions. Cheers.</p>",
