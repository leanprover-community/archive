I have a BS in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science.</p>\n<p>My graduate thesis is in AI focused on mathematical applications. I'm also doing a directed study on vertex operator algebras.</p>\n<p>I'm learning Lean because I want to formalize some of the mathematical structures underlying my research. I've started by formalizing the first chapter of Nozaradan's \"Introduction to Vertex Operator Algebras\" in Lean, and I'm hoping to eventually contribute formalizations relevant to VOAs and related areas.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to learning from this community.</p>",
