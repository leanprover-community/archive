I've been lurking here for a while now, but only recently started actually investing some serious time into learning Lean.</p>\n<p>In the process I've spent the last few weeks formalising some very basic Riemannian geometry, both to acquaint myself with the differential geometry section of Mathlib4 and to see how far I'd come and what obstacles arise. One thing I've noticed is that as far as I'm aware, Mathlib doesn't yet have the notion of piecewise differentiable/smooth paths, and also not anything related to the derivative of paths at all - could that maybe be a good first project? I've been looking to contribute for a while now, and this seems like something that is both entirely within my reach and will be useful to have in mathlib.</p>",
