I'm reattempting for the third time to put at discussion a new mathemical framework that I developed which ends up in being a service for compression, encryption and ATP with new interesting implications. Would anybody be interested in reading and discussing this framework I developed or even trying it for ATP purposes? Please let me know, I apologize for the previous posts if they seemed fake they genuinely were not. But I do understand the regulations and the warnings about using AI for writing content. I will not pursue such anymore, the theory is real though and currently I am in contact with Turin incubator in Italy opening a startup. The name indeed I chose to be HYPER. I am writing here in this forum for its implications under ATP. Thank you very much in advance</p>",
