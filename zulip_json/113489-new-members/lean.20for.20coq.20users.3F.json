Coq's iron curtain moving up and down the proof is one of the first thing I mention when explaining how Lean is more user friendly than Coq, sometimes even before the general use of unicode. And I've never met any Coq user defending that. Usually people mumble there is some extension somewhere which fixes this issue in Coq but it's no longer compatible with current Coq (this is general theme with what I've seen from Coq: there are so many people hacking it that almost every issue has been fixed by someone but there aren't any pair of fixes that are compatible). What do you do with the iron curtain that you cannot do with your up and down arrow key in Lean? Do you know you can even use left and right arrows in Lean to have a finer view of the proof state, for instance in case of multiple rewriting in the same tactic invocation? </p>\n<p>I have no difficulties imagining how trying another proof assistant can be frustrating, if only because your muscle memory keeps typing the wrong keywords or notation. And I know SSReflect has really nice tactics that Lean is missing. But I honestly have no idea why anyone would want the rigid curtain that prevents you from inspecting tactic state anywhere in your file without recompiling.</p>",
