        "content": "<p>Hi everyone, this is my first time on this Zulip.</p>\n<p>A few days ago I started a Lean4 project to formalize a mathematical proof I had recently written.  The github repository is at <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/symmetric_project\">https://github.com/teorth/symmetric_project</a> .  Unfortunately, I had recently tried to update my local copy of Mathlib (and simultaneously accepted a pull request from another user who had also updated) and this managed to break my local copy in a weird way.  I then tried to create a fresh local copy using the instructions from <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html</a> ; this did indeed create a new copy, but now lean cannot recognize Mathlib or any other packages and so the copy is functionally useless.  Here is a screenshot of the current status:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Mhq5iPY7q9LX5yTKz6nL6FXc/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Mhq5iPY7q9LX5yTKz6nL6FXc/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/Mhq5iPY7q9LX5yTKz6nL6FXc/image.png\"></a></div><p>I can't tell whether the problem is because the master github repository is itself broken, or something additional needs to be done locally.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Worst case I could start a completely new project and manually port over the small number of files I have, but I'm hoping there is a quicker fix.</p>",
