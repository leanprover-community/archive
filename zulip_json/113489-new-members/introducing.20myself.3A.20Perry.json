I was a math major in college, learning Lean right now and looking forward to contributing to mathlib!</p>\n<p>Lately I’ve been interested the relationship between combinatorial group theory and category theory, and I’m hoping to eventually make some contributions to mathlib on this topic.</p>\n<p>Here are informal statements of what I’m thinking about contributing. Part of the work (fun) for me would be getting a better grasp on the formalism here through attempting to write them in Lean:</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>1) Viewing Grp as a full sub-2-category of Cat, natural transformations between functors f,g: G—&gt;H correspond to elements x \\in G satisfying xf(G)x^-1 = g(G).</p>\n<p>And the corollaries that, in Grp as defined above…</p>\n<p>2) Nat(Id_G,Id_G) \\iso Inn(G),</p>\n<p>where Id_G is the identity homomorphism on G, and Inn(G) is the inner automorphism group on G.</p>\n<p>3) HNN extensions are coinserters in Grp.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>Since this is a somewhat obscure topic, it’d be great to know if anyone thinks this is outside the scope of mathlib before I start working on this. It seems like I'd be possible to fill up mathlib with tons of categorifications of classical results, which I think are cool in-and-of themselves, but I can't tell if that's the type of thing that the community wants.</p>\n<p>Also, if anyone has ideas about what an outline of the work would be to prove these, I’d love to hear it!</p>\n<p>I’ll also mention that I’m interested in adding classical theorems from combinatorial group theory too. It’s a little hard to tell what’s already in there right now, but as far as I can tell this topic hasn't made it into mathlib yet. Hoping someone will correct me if I’m wrong :)</p>\n<p>Nice to meet you!</p>",
