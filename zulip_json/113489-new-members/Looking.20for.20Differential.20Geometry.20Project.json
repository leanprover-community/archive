I thought it would be just a couple of pages, but it ended up being over 20 pages. I would like to formalize this into Lean as an alternate (more canonical IMHO) definition of tangent space. Derivation is already in mathlib4, but it is not yet connected to the model space stanard Lean definition of tangent space. More generally, we would like to start a discussion of the definition of manifold in Lean. I'm sure there are good reasons to add \"with corners\" as it is, but for someone working in Ricci flow, a far more important generalization for us is <strong>smooth orbifold with isolated singularities</strong>. These structures are actually smooth at the \"singularities\" in the sense that all geometric objects and morphisms are smooth by passing to the local lifts and considering them equivariantly. We also would like work on developing tensor calculus, and my Ph.D. student <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"959658\">@Yuan Liao</span> (with the help of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"634338\">@Michael Rothgang</span> ) is one of the people working on this.</p>",

There is a theorem of Hamilton where he proves convergence to constant curvature for the Ricci flow on surfaces (see the reference in <a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-33/issue-2/The-Ricci-flow-on-the-2-sphere/10.4310/jdg/1214446319.pdf\">https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-33/issue-2/The-Ricci-flow-on-the-2-sphere/10.4310/jdg/1214446319.pdf</a> ). This was generalized to 2-dimensional orbifolds with isolated singularities by his student Lang-Fang Wu (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpa.3160440302\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpa.3160440302</a> ), where the convergence is to a shrinking Ricci soliton. Note, Seifert fibered spaces be considered as circle (orbi)bundles over 2-dimensional orbifolds with isolated singularities. Extending the Hamilton--Perelman work, Kleiner and Lott (<a href=\"https://www.numdam.org/book-part/AST_2014__365__101_0/\">https://www.numdam.org/book-part/AST_2014__365__101_0/</a> ) gave a Ricci flow proof of the orbifold geometization conjecture/theorem.

This combines both Riemannian surfaces and integration by parts (via Stokes' theorem) in a simple, but conceptually important setting. This formula is the first place where an entropy monotonicity was directly connected to shrinking Ricci solitons (and was quoted by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0211159\">https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0211159</a> ). Note, the original proof of the convergence used an entropy-energy comparison (<a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-33/issue-2/The-Ricci-flow-on-the-2-sphere/10.4310/jdg/1214446319.pdf\">https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-33/issue-2/The-Ricci-flow-on-the-2-sphere/10.4310/jdg/1214446319.pdf</a> ), where the energy is the zeta function regularized definition of the determinant of the Laplacian as was studied, among others, by Osgood, Phillips, and Sarnak (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022123688900705\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022123688900705</a> ), and used an energy lower bound of Onofri. This 2D (relative) energy actually can be interpreted as a Bott--Chern secondary characteristic class, and in that sense, in a tangential way related to Donaldson's work on (Anti-Self-Dual) Hermitian--Yang--Mills on algebraic surfaces (<a href=\"https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/plms/s3-50.1.1\">https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/plms/s3-50.1.1</a> ). The determinant line bundles aspect was discussed by Donaldson in his work on Hermitian--Yang--Mills over algebraic manifolds, but the key force in that paper was actually a theorem of Mehta and Ramanathan in algebraic geometry where semi-stable bundles restricted to hyperplane sections are semi-stable, allowing for an induction argument on dimension (<a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/duke-mathematical-journal/volume-54/issue-1/Infinite-determinants-stable-bundles-and-curvature/10.1215/S0012-7094-87-05414-7.short\">https://projecteuclid.org/journals/duke-mathematical-journal/volume-54/issue-1/Infinite-determinants-stable-bundles-and-curvature/10.1215/S0012-7094-87-05414-7.short</a> ). In any case, the intergration by parts formula is one way to bypass the energy-entropy connection since in the 2D bad orbifold case, the energy is <strong>not</strong> bounded from below.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"945593\">@Bennett Chow</span> I absolutely agree with the roadmap you set forth for formalization in differential geometry. Beginning with the definition of a tangent space is an obviously necessary step. And simultaneously developing the cases for manifolds with boundary/corners would be prudent for many applications. I am less confident on the theory of orbifolds, as I am most confortable with the case of a simply connected manifold M quotient by a finite group Γ.</p>\n<p>Stokes Theorems and the Laplacian operator I agree are good goals to demonstrate progress in manifold theory. For instance, I have done some work in harmonic analysis, so I would be interested in proving some geometric results about the Laplace-Beltrami operator and it's eigenvalues/eigenfunctions. Some results about Ricci curvature and the Lie derivative will also likely be necessary before the work on Ricci flow can begin in earnest. As you suggest, working on the case of 2-dimensional Riemannian surfaces and Hamilton's Ricci Flow Surface Entropy could be a good place to start. I am also very interested in the topic of curvature and energy estimates/bounds that you brought up, especially in the pseudo-Riemannian setting as these arise in the work of e.g.  <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations-9780199230723?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Choquet-Bruhat</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11289\">Mondal</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0001091\">Anderson</a> for proving the existence/uniqueness of solutions to the Einstein Vacuum Equations, which would be a significant result for mathematical physics if it could be formalized.</p>",

Note, realistically, if Ricci flow is to have applications to smooth manifold topology in higher dimensions, it's going to be in 4D first. Here, Bamler's theory indicates the smooth orbifolds with isolated singularities is the correct category, even if one starts with smooth 4-manifolds (they arise by pinching spherical space forms). But key will be to able to do geometric analysis on these orbifolds, in particular, tensor calculus and extend Stokes' theorem, divergence theorem, integration by parts to this category.<br>\nFor the tangent spaces blueprint, we may not use it, but it was a good exercise for us.<br>\nThe submanifold theory is also important to Ricci flow, especially hypersurfaces. It would good e.g. to get second fundamental form and the mean curvature function/vector. I guess after that one of the first things to prove are the Gauss and Codazzi equations.</p>",

The homology algebra part of that project was not ready for mathlib, though and has been completely rewritten since then.
