Does <code>simp_all</code> behave similarly to 'take all hypotheses and <code>rw</code> them (both hi and &lt;-hi) as many times as you can without cancelling whatever rw you just did by doing <code>try rw [hi] </code> and, on the next line, <code>try rw [&lt;- hi]</code>? If not, which one is more powerful (meaning does one tactic simplify the proof state better) and is there a specific tactic for doing something similar to what I've described, but smarter to avoid checking earlier hypotheses?</p>",
