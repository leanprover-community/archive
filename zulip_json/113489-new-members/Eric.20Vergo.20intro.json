I spent my time there designing Macs, but recently left and will be pursuing a masters in math at Queens college starting this fall. I’m excited to dive in, and learn all of the things I missed the first time around. I’m still very much at the beginning of my higher-level math journey, but it is clear to me that ITPs are the future of mathematics. </p>\n<p>Let’s build something great.</p>",
