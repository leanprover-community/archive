Unfortunately I have been having a lot of red dots in the action section, which mostly leave me very puzzled. I never really know what to do, whether there is something actually wrong or just a little change that needs to be made. So, I guess, my question is: how do I proceed when the actions do not work? I think the only thing I changed recently is the blueprint and it does not compile any more, which is a bit mysterious to me. But it is not the first time and I would like to have a smoother experience setting up the project.</p>",
