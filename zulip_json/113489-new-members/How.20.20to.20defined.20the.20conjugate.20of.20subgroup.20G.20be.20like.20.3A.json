In fact, I ask this problem's  reason is the book <em>mathematics in Lean</em>. In sections of group, chapters 8.1.3 subgroup .The book say use the element of ambient group to defined cojugate. But I think, the <strong>ambient group</strong> is not really Mathematical terms.I was confused with it.</p>",
