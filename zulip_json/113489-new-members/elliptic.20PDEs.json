My day job is in geometric analysis, and I've recently been in contact with Ben Chow and Pietro Monticone about mathlib projects in this direction, but I am also very interested in the formalization of the theory of elliptic PDEs (independently of applications). Is it fair to say that enough of the prerequisites are in place that it is reasonable to be thinking about adding some of the standard material on elliptic PDE? Is any such work already underway? I would love to talk to anyone else with related interests and to help out if appropriate.</p>",

Briefly, what I meant was to prove the below lemma by applying the chain rule to <code>g := fun t =&gt; f (a + t \\smul v)</code> to reduce to the one-dimensional case and then to use the mean value theorem (well, I had originally said the one-dimensional Taylor's theorem) to finish; maybe there is a more efficient way to exploit what's already in the library, but this seems to do the job. Next I want to work on the maximum principle itself (at least at an interior point to start), and when I get that done, I would like to ask for feedback, in case you or another expert has time to take a look. For now, I'm quite certain that the proof I've written of the below is a stylistic mess (so will not share it at this stage), but can I ask you if the statement looks alright?

To address noncompactness, often cutoff functions are used, although in less common circumstances the Omori--Yau maximum principle is used <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022123685711548\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022123685711548</a> .

Now, the elliptic maximum principle is simply the multivariable first and second derivative tests, where the second derivative test gives the nonpositivity of the Hessian at a maximum point (and the nonnegativity of the Hessian at a minimum point). For this one can reduce this to considering straight lines in <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{R}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">R</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6644em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (and geodesics on Riemannian manifolds). So one does not need Taylor's theorem. After developing the scalar maximum principle for elliptic and parabolic equations, it will be useful for Ricci flow to develop the tensor maximum principle, see Section 9 of Hamilton's 3D 1982 paper: (<a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-17/issue-2/Three-manifolds-with-positive-Ricci-curvature/10.4310/jdg/1214436922.full\">https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-17/issue-2/Three-manifolds-with-positive-Ricci-curvature/10.4310/jdg/1214436922.full</a>) (more generally the maximum principle for systems) of Hamilton (in Sections 3 and 4 of his 4-d 1986 paper <a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-24/issue-2/Four-manifolds-with-positive-curvature-operator/10.4310/jdg/1214440433.pdf\">https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-24/issue-2/Four-manifolds-with-positive-curvature-operator/10.4310/jdg/1214440433.pdf</a>) [there is a precursor to this by Hans Weinberger <a href=\"https://memoriam.cse.umn.edu/hfw/Math/InvariantSets.pdf\">https://memoriam.cse.umn.edu/hfw/Math/InvariantSets.pdf</a> ]. That maximum principle is in the setting of symmetric covariant 2-tensors and more generally in terms of sections of Riemannian vector bundles, where the framework is in terms of fiber-wise convex sets that are invariant under parallel translation. The convexity is from the idea that the Laplacian operator averages things out, so given two points in the fiber-set, one wants the straight line segment between these two points to still be in the set. Assuming we develop the Riemannian geometry track in Lean, some applications are: (1) Elliptic application: [David Wiygul and I disucssed this] Give a proof of the Li--Yau lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a closed Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature in terms of the diameter <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239222762_Estimates_of_eigenvalues_of_a_compact_Riemannian_manifold\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239222762_Estimates_of_eigenvalues_of_a_compact_Riemannian_manifold</a> . (2) Parabolic application: Prove the standard lower estimate for the scalar curvature under Ricci flow. (3) A simpler parabolic application is a re-proof of the elementary fact that for a smooth solution to the linear heat equation <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>u</mi><mrow><mi>x</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">u_t = u_{xx}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">u</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.2806em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">t</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">u</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">xx</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> on the unit circle, we have the gradient estimate <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><msub><mi>u</mi><mi>x</mi></msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>C</mi><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">|u_x| \\leq C e^{-t}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">u</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">x</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">≤</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7936em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">e</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.7936em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">−</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

In general, the parabolic weak maximum principle is hugely important to Ricci flow and it would be great to develop it on manifolds. Expositions of the parabolic maximum principle, in the context of Ricci flow are given in some of my coauthored AMS books <a href=\"https://bookstore.ams.org/bennett-chow\">https://bookstore.ams.org/bennett-chow</a> . In particular, an introductions is in Chapter 4 of my book with Dan Knopf (Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, Vol. 110) and some more advanced versions in Chapters 10 and 12 of the multi-authored book Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, Vol. 144, with various applications in all the books.</p>",
