Everything seemed to work fine, but when I open 02_Overview.lean or any other files with imports, I get the error <code>unknown package 'data'</code> in the Lean infoview. I double-checked everything and I don't think I missed any steps. I can see mathlib in the lake-packages folder, so I don't know why it's not working. Can somebody help me out?</p>",
