In the final file, I get to a part where I have the hypothesis  <code>x - 1/(n+1) &lt; u n </code>  and I want to prove <code>x-1/(n+1) &lt;= u n</code> which seems like it should be short work for  <code>linarith</code>.  However, linarith complains it can't find a contradiction.  I tried to go step-by-step with a calc block, but I can't make that work either.  The example solution uses <code>le_of_lt</code> which does work for me, though this lemma is not described or used anywhere else.  </p>\n<p>What's going on here?  Is something about the terms confusing linarith?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/_k-Quj0UgIf6qJTZ0q1-d2se/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/_k-Quj0UgIf6qJTZ0q1-d2se/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/_k-Quj0UgIf6qJTZ0q1-d2se/image.png\"></a></div>",
