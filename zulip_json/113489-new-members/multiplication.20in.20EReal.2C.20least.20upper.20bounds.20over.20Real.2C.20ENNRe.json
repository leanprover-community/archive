For EReal, it is explained in a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Real/EReal.html#EReal.mul\">comment</a>; you can go to the source to see the details.</p>\n<p>For ENNReal, it is somewhat hidden. ENNReal is defined as <code>WithTop NNReal</code>, that is, NNReal (nonnegative reals) to which we add a top element. NNReal already has a multiplication, and ENNReal extends it using the construction in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Order/Ring/WithTop.html#WithTop.top_mul\">Algebra.Order.Ring.WithTop</a>. Again, you can look at that file and its source to see that <code>0 * a = 0</code> for any <code>a</code>, including top.</p>",
