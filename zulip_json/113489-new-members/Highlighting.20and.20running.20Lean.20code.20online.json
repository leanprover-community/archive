However, this may be too advanced for my specific use cases.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I recently discovered an elegant website written in French that beautifully illustrates Lean proofs. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/enseignement/math114/\">Learn Math 114</a>.</p>\n<p>![Screenshot](<a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhihongecnu/PicBed4/picgo/20230831234530.png\">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhihongecnu/PicBed4/picgo/20230831234530.png</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhihongecnu/PicBed4/picgo/20230831234530.png\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/a27d1b6466428aa09663d8271ac5f7c2bb7d2cb4/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6a7364656c6976722e6e65742f67682f7a6869686f6e6765636e752f506963426564342f706963676f2f32303233303833313233343533302e706e67\"></a></div><p>The presentation style on this site is truly impressive and serves as a great source of inspiration for my own website.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your valuable assistance!</p>",

        "content": "<p>About Q1, there are two main options. You could use <a href=\"https://pygments.org/\">pygment</a> to prerender the web pages. This is what we do on the community website for instance. Then you only need the pygment css file. You could also try some javascript syntax highlighting. At some point we created <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/highlightjs-lean/\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/highlightjs-lean/</a> but the reason we did that is no longer relevant and I think nobody is maintaining it.</p>",

But this is only for Lean 3. It was meant to be replaced by <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk\">LeanInk</a> but I'm afraid this is no longer actively maintained (but I'd be delighted to see someone investing time there).</p>",
