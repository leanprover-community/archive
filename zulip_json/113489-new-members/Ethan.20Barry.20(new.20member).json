I haven't taken many classes from the math side of my degree yet, but I've worked through a few proofs-based textbooks like <em>Linear Algebra Done Right</em> in my spare time.</p>\n<p>This semester I'm going to formalize some problems in the Foundations class as my extra coursework for Honors. I think it's an achievable goal, but I'd feel more comfortable if I had some resources on Lean as a programming language. Are y'all aware of any blog posts or articles that focus on that aspect? I've been poking through <em>FP in Lean,</em> but something more condensed would help.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance, and I look forward to interacting more!</p>\n<p>—Ethan B.</p>",
