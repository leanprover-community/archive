My project is in statistics but so far I'm working with measure theory much more than with any data: I'm developing statistical tests for the calibration of a sequence of forecasts, all made for the same observation one after the other. I'm hoping to formalise some of my results in Lean, and maybe one day to contribute some stuff on random measures and conditional distributions to mathlib. Glad to be here!</p>",
