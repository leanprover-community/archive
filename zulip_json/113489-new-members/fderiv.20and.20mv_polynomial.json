At best, I can transform it into <code>‚Äñ(fderiv ‚Ñù coe (‚Äñx‚Äñ ^ 2)).comp (bit0 (‚áë(innerSL ‚Ñù) x))‚Äñ</code>.  Is there a way to transform it into a mv_polynomial, or something else? Or perhaps a way to show it is bounded by some norms dependent on <code>E' </code>?  Any ideas would help :)</p>",
