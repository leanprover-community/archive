I then compared how similar the output was when prompted with just the name, or just the statement, to measure \"how much data is contained in a theorem name\".  Of note, theorem names from Lean \"contained more content\" than those from Isabelle, while theorem statements (the symbolic statement) from Isabelle \"contained more content\" than those from Lean. </p>\n<p>While this for a data science capstone project, I would like to potential write up the results for a general audience.  </p>\n<p>I don't know if/where I could considering sharing my pipeline and results. Any suggestions?</p>",
