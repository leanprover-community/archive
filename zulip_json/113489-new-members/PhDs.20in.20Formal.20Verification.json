        "content": "<p>Hello! I'm a computer science masters student, graduating Spring 2025, focused on AI. This summer, I came to the conclusion that I'm really excited about formal verification applied to AI, so I'm planning to pursue a PhD in the subject. I'm going to start exploring by studying Lean. But more generally, we're already in the stage where I should be looking at what sorts of PhDs I should apply to. Before my revelation this summer, I didn't even think I wanted to do a PhD, so I feel a bit out of my depth. I don't know what sorts of professors and universities are likely to want/be good for doing a formal verification-relevant PhD. It's also worth noting my pure math background isn't very strong; I've self-studied some of real analysis and that's mostly it. </p>\n<p>If anyone can provide suggestions/directions for where I should be looking at, or any particular maths I should be studying, or other related details, I would really appreciate it. I apologize if I'm misusing this space; I've been unsure of where to ask these kinds of questions, and I was recommended to try here. Thanks in advance!</p>",
