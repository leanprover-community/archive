I've recently been (finally) studying a bit more maths and am getting into Lean.  This is actually about my 3rd attempt.  A while ago I had a go at the natural numbers game, then a little later I tried working through \"Mathematics in Lean\" but sort of bounced off.  This time I've got hold of Buzzard's \"Formalizing Mathematics\" which for whatever reason seems to be sticking with me much better.</p>\n<p>P.S. I'm a (neo)vim user rather than a vscoder.</p>",
