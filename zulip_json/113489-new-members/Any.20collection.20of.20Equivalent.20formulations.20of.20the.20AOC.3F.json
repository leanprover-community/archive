I am doing this for fun so I don't care too much if this goes nowhere, but I am wondering if this kind of project has been done already and if the results are publicly available.  If there exists previous work in this direction , I would like like having a cheat sheet available if I get stuck. </p>\n<p>TLDR:  Is there any public lean4  proofs of the various restatements of the axiom of choice?</p>",
