I was only inspired to try using AI to generating Lean codes to see how that works here from this video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZr54G7ec7A&amp;t=1057s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZr54G7ec7A&amp;t=1057s</a> ,which was why I tried this out.  I would also appreciate assistance with making correct my code if possible.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"zZr54G7ec7A\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZr54G7ec7A&amp;t=1057s\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/ee2c1aeb6ed93b07173e2bbffd2c02ad91afb614/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f7a5a7235344737656337412f6d7164656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
