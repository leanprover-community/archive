For example, I learned from <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/lean3changes.html#sugar-for-simple-functions\">this page</a> how to create prefix \"sections\" from operators, but then I have to figure out how to enter the character <code>· </code>.  After some investigation, I happened to see that I can enter in vim/nvim with <code>C-v ub7</code>, but surely there's an easier and more memorable way.  (My first attempt was the LaTeX command <code>\\cdot</code>, but that's not the correct character--something for another post.)</p>",
