Here is an example of a development with rather tedious proofs:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/namin/LeanSketcher/blob/main/StlcInd.lean\">https://github.com/namin/LeanSketcher/blob/main/StlcInd.lean</a></p>\n<p>In contrast, the Dafny equivalent is much more digestible and scales well when adding new constructs to the model.</p>\n<p>I know a little about grind now, and &lt;;&gt;, but I still wouldn't know how to make the proofs in the file above more regular and automated.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts? Tricks?</p>\n<p>Eventually, I'd like to metaprogram a sketching facility in Lean  for to streamline such proofs.</p>\n<p>Thanks, ~n</p>",
