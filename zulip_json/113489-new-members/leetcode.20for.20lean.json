        "content": "<p>I like doing small programming / algorithmic exercises and <a href=\"http://leetcode.com\">leetcode.com</a> has been a great site to log in every few days and try to solve the daily challenge. Almost all problems are at most 50 lines of code, but turns out there is tremendous variety of problems, while staying with in the constraints - only stdlibs for any programming language needed, no advanced CS needed. For easy and medium problems, fairly competent programmer can jump in and solve a problem in &lt;30min, get a small dopamine boost and move on with their day. </p>\n<p>I think math has similarly large reservoir of interesting fun problems that can be both challenging and still generally solvable quickly without getting into advanced topics. IMO problems are a great example.</p>\n<p>With Lean one can even start to envision a site where a daily problem is shown and one has to write their Lean proof and it is checked and accepted or denied. After all programming = proving (Curry-howard), but when I start to think about the details I am not so sure how would this work in practice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how much of mathlib can or should be used. Should some of mathlib be hidden intentionally? Should the right theorem be highlighted somehow. Generally it feels mathlib is much larger than a standard language lib - where one has to memorize array and hashmap APIs, but after that they can basically solve any leetcode problem with maybe tops ~ 100 APIs. In Lean proving it feels like the order of magnitude is larger.</li>\n<li>Would it be fun to allow high-power tactics like <code>grind</code> or intentionally ban them.</li>\n<li>while there are a lot of theorems to pick from - large number of them are trivial, how to find the ones that have some sort of mathematical challenge to them (beyond just telling lean what to do) - like showing lim a + b = lim a + lib b, by picking the right epsilons.</li>\n<li>are there branches of undergraduate math that have more of such proofs - I was thinking elementary number theory maybe?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Has anyone thought about this? Would anyone be interested in doing daily lean challenges if this existed?</p>",
