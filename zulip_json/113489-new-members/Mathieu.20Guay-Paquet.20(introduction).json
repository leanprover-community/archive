I'd like to consider myself both a real mathematician and a computer scientist, and it makes me sad that we often talk about these two groups as opposites, even though I can tell when I'm being more mathy or more programmy.</p>\n<p>Some of my favourite math things are representations of the symmetric group, symmetric functions, graded Hopf algebras, formal power series, combinatorial algorithms, and bijective proofs. My hope with Lean (and/or other systems) is to formalize the recent research (including my own) on the combinatorics of Hessenberg varieties, because there are enough implicit, fiddly, tedious bits in there that I don't fully trust humans (including me) to check everything.</p>",
