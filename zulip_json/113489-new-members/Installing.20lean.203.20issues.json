For a first impression, you can probably hide a lot of lean's complexity. I've wondered what it would look like to craft a gentle introduction to formalization in this way. Even if it just makes for improved error messages based on the fact that the author understands exactly what the student is attempting to accomplish. If really polished, I could imagine teaching high-school students some of this stuff in an interactive, iterative feedback environment. Sounds cool.</p>\n<p>It seems like there would be at least 2 big downsides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's also not clear how hard it would be to maintain such a project as Lean isn't that stable yet. It would probably be a lot of work for an uncertain amount of benefit. It's often trial by fire that shows what helps and what doesn't.</li>\n<li>As students move beyond the DSL, they'd face some confusion about what changes and what stays the same. For example, the Natural Numbers Game changes a few tactics a bit and has a different definition for the <code>≤</code> operator. I think they are good choices, but once in a while you'll see a question here that gets asked as a direct result of not realizing this.</li>\n</ol>",

The Lean 3 version can still be run online, in a browser. </p>\n<p>Logic and Proof has students writing proof terms instead of tactic proofs, which has the advantage of highlighting the logical structure of a proof. But it is hard to get the syntax right and that causes problems for students. If I were to do it again, I would use tactic proofs exclusively; structuring tactics like <code>have</code> and <code>show</code> serve the same purpose, and they are more robust and give students more feedback. I think Joseph is taking steps in that direction.</p>\n<p>There are lots of other good <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/teaching/\">teaching materials based on Lean 4</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is a link to the <a href=\"https://jlh18.github.io/LogicAndMathematicalInquiryWebsite/\">lean 4 version</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Jlh18/LogicAndMathematicalInquiry\">github repo</a>.
