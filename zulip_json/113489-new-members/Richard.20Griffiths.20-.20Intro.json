I've a side of me that has a wild interest in conceptual maths that has little concrete foundation in any formal education in maths at all. </p>\n<p>So this is part of a deliberate plan to do something about that: learn how to do the methodical work involved by using Lean. And actually understand the subject much more thoroughly.</p>\n<p>UK user here, so hi to anyone in my general vicinity!</p>\n<p>I'm also doing a side quest in reading Bronstein's 2025 paper, math background for Geometric deep learning. As in rereading and attempt to properly follow it all. Hence wanting to improve my basic knowledge.</p>\n<p>I've an interest in Ai, from a hobby enthusiast viewpoint, so anyone with a overlapping interest, hi to you too. I am one of those slightly frustrating types - self taught, knowledge full of odd gaps, ommissions, strange assumptions and peculiar ignorance-but that is a big part of why I'm tackling Lean. And joining this community.</p>\n<p>Hoping some of it will sink in! <span aria-label=\"rolling on the floor laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f923\" role=\"img\" title=\"rolling on the floor laughing\">:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:</span></p>\n<p>Have a good Christmas everyone I've not met yet. Which is pretty much 100% of you.</p>",
