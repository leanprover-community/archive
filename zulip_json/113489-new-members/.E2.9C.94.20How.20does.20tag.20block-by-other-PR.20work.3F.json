I manually added a <code>block-by-other-PR</code> tag to PR B and it was removed by the bot. I am confused about this <code>block-by-other-PR</code> tag. How does this  <a href=\"https://github.com/mathlib4-dependent-issues-bot\">mathlib4-dependent-issues-bot</a> work to add or remove the <code>block-by-other-PR</code> tag?  Thank you!</p>",
