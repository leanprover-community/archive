Although the code needs to be cleaned up a lot. (I didn't even know the linter existed when I started the project, then I decided to keep it off for a while to maintain momentum). I'm sure there's a lot in there that I didn't do the ideomatic way, but I'm learning quickly and having a blast. </p>\n<p>Feel free to reach out.  Cheers.</p>",

It is in there a few times though.</p>\n<p>I also think I backtracked on simpa a few times at the start because I forgot that, although \"rwa\" uses \"at\" syntax (ie. \"rwa [h] at a\") , \"simpa\" uses \"using\" syntax like in your example.</p>",

I had a go at it 2 years ago but abandoned it for locale theory. Recently I picked it up again and decided to start from scratch (whenever I find time...). Mathlib now has a good definition of equidecomposability <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Equidecomp#doc\">docs#Equidecomp</a>. There is still some work needing to be done (there was some discussion you might find interesting at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30330\">#30330</a>). This result for FreeGroups <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=FreeGroup.Orbit.duplicate#doc\">docs#FreeGroup.Orbit.duplicate</a> is also interesting for banach tarski.<br>\nI am currently working on proving that F_2 is isomorphic to a subgroup of SO3. <br>\n(I can't take a deeper look at your codebase right now but I will certainly do that).</p>",

When I try to prove the goals of A^T * T = 1 and det A = 1, I get an intractable mess.  It would seem this might be a problem someone has already tackled.
