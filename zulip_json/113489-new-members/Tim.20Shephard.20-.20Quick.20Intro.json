For the last few years I have spent a quite a bit of time in ML and LLMs (top 1% on AI Competitions).  </p>\n<p>Recently, I've noticed a few misconceptions that have appeared in math papers around LLMs and postings in social media from math experts.   They aren't fundamental misconceptions, but enough that I believe some important people are working at a disadvantage and wanted to help in anyway that I can.</p>\n<p>In short, my goal here is to help ensure that folks in the lean community have a baseline understanding of LLMs/AI and ML and their capabilities to accelerate auto-formalization efforts around lean.</p>",
