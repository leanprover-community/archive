(I'm also interested in their general mathematics capabilities, but I recognize that that's getting off-topic for this forum.) Is there any evidence, even anecdotal evidence, that the pay versions are significantly more \"knowledgeable\" about Lean? If so, are any of them particularly good, or are they all about the same?</p>",

For what it's worth, I've found the pro version of Gemini to be significantly better than the standard versions of Gemini / ChatGPT / Perplexity when working with Lean. Gemini Pro is still not brilliant, but I find it helpful more often than not, which wasn't the case with the standard versions.
