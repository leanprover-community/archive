When I tried <code>/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/install_macos.sh)\" &amp;&amp; source ~/.profile</code>, I got an error message so I instead tried to it step by step as detailed on <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html</a></p>\n<p>When I tried to install elan in Terminal, it didn't work so I went to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases/tag/v1.0.6\">https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases/tag/v1.0.6</a> to do it manually. However I don't think it worked because after successfully completing the other steps, my test file is not working in VS Code. I have attached screenshots of what it is showing in VS Code and the error message I get when trying to install using <code>/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/install_macos.sh)\" &amp;&amp; source ~/.profile</code>.

The link I copied into my initial reply was the instructions I followed to install Homebrew again. After I did that, the command that does everything in one didn't work, so I again had to follow the step by step page. I'm afraid I can't remember how I finally got elan to work but I know I also had issues with gmp as I kept getting errors saying directory not empty; I fixed this by manually going into the folder and deleting what was in it (I know that was a bit risky!). At one of the stages I also kept getting the error <code>Error: An unexpected error occurred during the 'brew link' step: The formula built, but is not symlinked</code> but I fixed that using brew link.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry this isn't enough detail to instruct others, unfortunately my understanding of Terminal and Homebrew etc is not strong enough to understand exactly what is happening at each stage, and I didn't note down what my problems were. I hope this helps anyway!</p>",
