I am looking at the <code>number_theory.padics.padic_numbers</code> file, and inside two things defined that I am wondering about - <code>padic_norm_e</code> and the notation <code>|| ||</code>. They are similar in that they essentially define the same thing: <code>\\u padic_norm_e n = || n ||</code>. However, they also have different type signatures:<code>padic_norm_e</code> is an actual function that takes on rational values, while the <code>|| ||</code> is a <em>real</em> norm that takes on real values. Even worse, the function names seems to be very messed up. For example, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/padic_norm_e.eq_of_norm_add_lt_left\">docs#padic_norm_e.eq_of_norm_add_lt_left</a> is an inequality on <code>|| ||</code>, despite living in the namespace <code>padic_norm_e</code>. Do you guys think it is a problem, like is it inconsistent with mathlib naming conventions?</p>",
