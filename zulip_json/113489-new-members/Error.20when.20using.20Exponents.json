I found course materials online and I'm trying to extend their first hw assignment (<a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/317-f24/homeworks/hw1-handout.pdf\">cs.cmu.edu/~crary/317-f24/homeworks/hw1-handout.</a>. You'll note that this <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/317-f24/software.html\">course uses DCheck instead of Lean</a> so I'm definitely not a student in the course looking for answers to their homework assignment. From the assignment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fermat’s Little Theorem states that if p is prime, then for any integer a, (a p − a) mod p = 0. Also note that (2422687 − 2) mod 422687 = 376010.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am currently trying to implement a nonconstructive proof that the integer 422687 is composite. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">example</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∃</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Int</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">^</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">%</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Are you aware of more examples that use exponents in proofs without using tactics?
