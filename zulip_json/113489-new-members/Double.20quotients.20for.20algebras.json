Now I'm a PhD student at St Andrews (UK) working on finite permutation groups. I'm preparing for my first PR, generalising definitions and lemmas on double quotients from rings to algebras. This is a easy topic to get myself started, suggested to me by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"464700\">@David Ang</span>. Could someone invite me to the mathlib repo on GtiHub? My handle is \"wupr\".</p>",
