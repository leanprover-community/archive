I would be happy to try to contribute to Mathlib if I am able to find a project that matches my ability.</p>\n<p>One subject that I have professionally worked with a lot, but that does not seem to be formalized yet, is abstract simplicial complexes and the general approach to combinatorial topology (the toolset of simplicial complexes before geometric realization). My guess would be that, as soon as geometric realization happens, this is a tough task, but introducing the combinatorial toolset seems a reasonable exercise.</p>\n<p>I have seen that simplicial sets have been realized in quite a bit of detail already. Would a more combinatorics-flavored theory from a topology/triangulation perspective be of any interest?</p>",
