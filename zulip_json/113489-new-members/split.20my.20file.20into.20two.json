What is a Lean \"module\"?    Should I have different \"sections\"?   All that section do, I think, <br>\nis control the scope of declarations.  The only thing I'm declaring is the names of my lemmas.  So they should <br>\nall be accessible from my entire package,  I think.    But now I have two sections  (NF1 and NF2) in my two <br>\nfiles, and the second file uses theorems from the first and there is no problem accessing them,  so I guess <br>\nthe section did not really restrict the scope of their declarations (?)   I don't know what my \"sections\" are doing.</p>",

        "content": "<p>A module is a single file, starting with a list of imports, and then the rest is as if it is contained in an implicit section.  The module system is how Lean resolves which code to load for <code>import</code> statements.</p>\n<p>A section groups together things like <code>variables</code>, <code>open</code>, and other locally defined things (such as <code>private</code> definitions). Orthogonal to modules, there is a namespace system that groups together definitions under the prefix specified by the <code>namespace</code> declaration -- this also introduces an implicit section for local things.  (Namespaces are sort of like Common Lisp <em>packages</em> or Mathematica <em>contexts</em>.)  Since a module is as if there is an implicit section, you'll need to <code>open</code> the namespaces you're interested in within each separate module.</p>\n<p>I use sections for two reasons: (1) grouping together related definitions for documentation reasons only and (2) to control the current variables and opened namespaces.  (By the way, <code>open</code> essentially just copies the definitions within a given namespace into the current section's list of names that can be referenced.  There's no corresponding operation of closing a namespace.)</p>\n<p>There's a chance some of your errors might be because of stale olean files, so you might need to delete them (and maybe restart Lean? I'm not sure).</p>",
