For example, it didn't look like <code>/leanok</code> or <code>/lean</code> \"injected\" anything if that makes sense. </p>\n<p>For example, in <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/pfr/blob/master/blueprint/src/chapter/approx_hom_pfr.tex\">PFR</a>, the proof is actually written out in Latex.</p>\n<p>Am I missing something or am I just not using it properly?</p>\n<p>I'm looking for a tool that takes my Lean code as-is and basically generates human readable output without me having to do a lot of boilerplate. </p>\n<p>I started a simple project with Blueprint <a href=\"https://github.com/nstebbins/math-theorems/tree/main\">here</a> but I haven't managed to generate the proofs yet.</p>",
