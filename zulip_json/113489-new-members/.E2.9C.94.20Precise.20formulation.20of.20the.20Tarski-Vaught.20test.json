(If I’m not mistaken there shouldn’t be much of a difference between the textbook notion of expanding the language with extra constant symbols and adding them to the set of variables, which also feels closer than having an L.formula in n+1 variables of which the first n are specialised) </p>\n<p>I’m wondering what was the motivation behind the current spelling.
