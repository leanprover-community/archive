I'm considering supporting τ = 2π = 6.28318... in Mathlib.<br>\nAs you may know, τ, defined to be the ratio of a circle’s circumference (length) to its radius, has been advocated for 15 years to be the \"true circle constant\", according to <a href=\"https://www.tauday.com/tau-manifesto\">https://www.tauday.com/tau-manifesto</a>. However, it seems that τ is still not supported in Mathlib.<br>\nTo support τ, we'll introduce <code>Real.tau</code>, and have <code>Mathlib.Data.Real.Tau.Irrational</code> to prove that τ is irrational, etc.<br>\nI still have little knowledge about Lean, and I consider contributing τ as a chance to learn more about the Mathlib. Is there someone interested in this topic? Any suggestions? Glad to hear from you!</p>",

But in formalization it is not,  because one needs what is called a \"simp normal form\". If we allow all three of these symbols to be \"primitive\" then this is a massive problem for formalization, because then the number of lemmas we need goes up by a factor of three, causing a huge amout of unnecessary overhead. So we have to decide the precisely one of these is \"primitive\" and already we decided that the answer is that the primitive one is <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">π</span></span></span></span>.

This is completely pointless as far as mathlib is concerned because we gain nothing. It is true that there are some lemmas in mathlib which mention <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">2\\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">π</span></span></span></span> which then become \"simpler\" with <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>τ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\tau</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.1132em;\">τ</span></span></span></span>, but <strong>from the point of view of formalization</strong> it is still a bad idea to make this change, because as I already explained it is more important for formalization to have one \"normal form\" for everything than it is to have lemmas which are three characters shorter. This is why mathlib is not interested in having <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>τ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\tau</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.1132em;\">τ</span></span></span></span>. Let me stress that rhis is nothing to do with the Tau manifesto debate -- this is a pragmatic decision based on how the formalization of mathematics is done. The fact that some lemmas would be slightly shorter with <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>τ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\tau</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.1132em;\">τ</span></span></span></span>, and some would be slightly longer, and that maybe it is the case that more would be shorter than longer (or maybe it is not the case) is <strong>irrelevant</strong>; what is relevant is that we cannot support 3 times as many lemmas about fundamental terms in this situation because it is too much pain for too little gain, and we already put too much effort into making <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">π</span></span></span></span> the fundamental term.</p>\n<p>In short: arguments from formalization override arguments from the Tau manifesto, because mathlib is a formalization project.</p>\n<p>There is nothing stopping you having <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>τ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\tau</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.1132em;\">τ</span></span></span></span> in your own project.</p>",

I’ll fork Mathlib and do it on my own, and τists may be interested in it. Now I understand that the standard Mathlib has good reasons not introducing τ, so temporarily I won’t consider contributing τ to Mathlib again. When I get my stuff done, I’ll show the link to my fork here, so everyone can see it. In my project, there would be no π at all.</p>",
