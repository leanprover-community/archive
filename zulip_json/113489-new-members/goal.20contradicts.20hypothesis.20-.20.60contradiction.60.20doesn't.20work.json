    {
        "content": "<p>A few comments:</p>\n<p>The <code>contradiction</code> tactic looks for a contradiction among the hypotheses.  A hypothesis that contradicts the goal doesn't count.  Yes, it's a little unusual to have a hypothesis that contradicts the goal, but there's nothing wrong with it, and there's no need to do anything about it.  It can even happen that a hypothesis <code>h : ¬P</code> can be useful for proving the goal <code>P</code> -- I'll give a short example below.</p>\n<p>I think MoP introduces proof by contradiction as a method of proving a goal of the form <code>¬P</code>: you assume <code>P</code> and derive a contradiction.  That is a common use of proof by contradiction, but it's not the only one.  You can also use proof by contradiction to prove a positive statement: you can prove <code>P</code> by assuming <code>¬P</code> and deriving a contradiction.  To do that, I would suggest a tactic that, as far as I can tell, is not covered in MoP.  If your goal is <code>P</code>, then the tactic <code>by_contra h</code> adds the hypothesis <code>h : ¬P</code> and sets the goal to be <code>False</code>.  By the way, if your goal is <code>¬P</code>, then <code>by_contra h</code> will add the hypothesis <code>h : P</code> and set the goal to be <code>False</code>.  So <code>by_contra</code> works for both kinds of proof by contradiction (proving a negative statement or a positive statement), whereas the approach used in MoP works only for one kind (proving a negative statement).  I'm not sure why Heather chose to teach the more limited approach to proof by contradiction in MoP.  I prefer to use <code>by_contra</code> for both kinds.</p>\n<p>Why would you use proof by contradiction for a positive goal?  Well, one reason is that it gives you a way to use a negative hypothesis.  In your proof, after <code>intro g</code> you have <code>g  : ¬(P → Q)</code>.  Remember that in Lean that means <code>(P → Q) → False</code>.  So if your goal is <code>False</code> (as it is if you're doing a proof by contradiction), then <code>apply g</code> will change the goal to <code>P → Q</code>.  I have rewritten your proof a bit, using this idea:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Mathlib</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Tactic</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">example</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">P</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Q</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Prop</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">¬</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">P</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Q</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">↔</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">P</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∧</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">¬</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Q</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">by</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">constructor</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"bp\">·</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">intro</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">g</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">by_cases</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">P</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"bp\">·</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">constructor</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"bp\">·</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">exact</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">h</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"bp\">·</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">by_contra</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"c1\">--(1)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">apply</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">g</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">intro</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">exact</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"bp\">·</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">by_contra</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"c1\">--(2)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"n\">apply</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">g</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"bp\">·</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Starting at the line labeled (1), I have changed your proof.

It has the benefit of negating any goal, as you say, and it also means you don't need to lean about using <code>intro</code> which is introduced with quantifiers....</p>\n<p>I also want to check my thinking on positive goals. A positive goal <code>P</code> is <code>¬¬P</code> and so we can think of it as a negation of <code>¬P</code> and so assume <code>¬P</code> and aim to show a contradiction. Is that correct? I'm asking as in my mind there's nothing special about a positive goal, it is just the negation of the negation.</p>\n<p>Anyway I will try a little longer to see if I can find a solution using only MoP's tactics - then give up, in the light the very string case you made for <code>by_contra</code>.</p>",

I just meant \"it doesn't start with <code>¬</code>.\"  But as you say, a positive statement can be rewritten as an equivalent negative statement by using a double negative.  And sometimes a negative statement can be rewritten as an equivalent positive statement by using <code>push_neg</code>.</p>\n<p>Here's an application of your idea:  If your goal is <code>P</code>, then you can get the effect of <code>by_contra h</code> by doing <code>apply not_not.mp</code>, which will change the goal to <code>¬¬P</code>, followed by <code>intro h</code>.  So you can do proof by contradiction with a positive goal using only tactics introduced in MoP.  But it seems easier to use <code>by_contra</code>.</p>",
