I've managed to get lake to output <code>.so</code> files, with <code>lake build Main:dynlib</code> (for a file named <code>Main</code>) but these all include a bunch of undefined symbols for standard library functions, which is causing issues when I try to open the <code>.so</code> in a different languages's FFI. </p>\n<p>After learning a little bit about linking (I knew nothing beginning of today) and inspecting the <code>.so</code> with <code>nm -D</code> the other language's FFI seems correct in yelling at me as a bunch of standard library functions are undefind... but I can't seem to figure out, how can I get a standalone dynamic library? The structure of my project is, I have one <code>Main.lean</code> file containing several functions. My lakefile looks like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"TOML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"Main\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">version</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"0.1.0\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">[[lean_lib]]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"Main\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>How might I build a self-contained dynamic library with the standard library included?</p>",

It would be great if you could open a small RFC with your use case. Pending that, copying over the dynlibs from the toolchain directory should work.</p>",
