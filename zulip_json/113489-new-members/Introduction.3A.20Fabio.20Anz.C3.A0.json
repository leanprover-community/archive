I'm interested in the foundations of physics. </p>\n<p>I've worked on quantum gravity, dynamical foundations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, open quantum systems theory and quantum information. Most recently, I've been doing a lot of work in geometric quantum mechanics: doing open quantum systems theory with differential geometry and measure theory. </p>\n<p>I've been interested in Lean since the talk by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"653351\">@Joseph Tooby-Smith</span> at my group and I have been chatting with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"424214\">@Tyler Josephson ⚛️</span> about using lean in science. </p>\n<p>I'm currently learning Lean 4 and I have a promising student who is also taken on the challenge. </p>\n<p>Looking forward to many interactions!!</p>",
