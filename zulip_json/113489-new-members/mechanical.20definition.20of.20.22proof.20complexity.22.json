Made me wonder if someone has thought about defining a syntactically computable measure of \"proof complexity\". Shroeder-Bernstein's theorem needs a mini-insight in defining <code>sbFun</code> while all other theorems are just \"follow your nose\". </p>\n<p>Something akin to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity</a> in computational programs. Similarly to cyclomatic_complexity, this would be heuristic and \"game-able\", but still can be cool to run over mathlib to point out where the \"strokes of insights\" lie .</p>\n<p>A first approximation could be lines of Lean, or maybe number of new definitions. Has anyone looked into something like this before?</p>",
