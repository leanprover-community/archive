I followed the instructions on <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html</a> and VSCode slowly use more and more of my (laughable) ~4GB of usable RAM. Once VSCode has around 2048MB of memory used up my computer just starts acting like it's on its deathbed. Is this normal?</p>",
