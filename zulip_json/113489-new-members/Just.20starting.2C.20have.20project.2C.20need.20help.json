I have a project that I want to formalize with LEAN. It's the Moebius problem.  <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoebiusProblem.html\">https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoebiusProblem.html</a>  My work on it so far consists of hundreds of tiny lemmas, each of a similar nature.  Before going ahead I would like assurance that errors have not crept in.  Also I hope that after verifying what I have done with LEAN that perhaps an AI can find some patterns that I have not identified and help me continue. </p>\n<p>How do you suggest I get started? I would probably need a LEAN experienced person to collaborate with me or at least help me get oriented and launched.  Any takers?  A \"bring-your-own-project workshop\" if such exists would be helpful. </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for you help and encouragement!</p>",
