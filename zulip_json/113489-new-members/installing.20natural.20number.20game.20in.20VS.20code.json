I've just finished NNG and was slightly disappointed that it used lean3 as I found out after finishing it. is there a version of Maths_Challenges (<a href=\"https://cocalc.com/share/public_paths/f014cd1885a22e8665a728be825e563fc79b7e1f\">https://cocalc.com/share/public_paths/f014cd1885a22e8665a728be825e563fc79b7e1f</a>) for lean4?</p>",

This may not be what people are looking for when they want to <strong>play</strong> it in vscode though. Though it would work for someone who knows they will be without internet or something like that.</p>",
