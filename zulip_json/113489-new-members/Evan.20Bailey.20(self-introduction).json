I have read/solved most of Mathematics in Lean and I have really enjoyed using Lean so far!</p>\n<p>I would love the opportunity to contribute to Mathlib! Given my background, I would probably be most helpful in the (very broad) areas of computability/complexity theory, graph theory, lattice combinatorics, decision procedures, or metaprogramming. If anyone knows about specific topics that I could help with, especially in those areas, please let me know!</p>\n<p>Additionally, I have some ideas about how to formalize the notion of the arclength of a curve in a PseudoEMetricSpace and some related topics (rectifiable curves, length spaces, geodesic curves, geodesic spaces, unique geodesic spaces, the Hopf-Rinow theorem, etc.). This would probably consist of two new files - Topology/EMetricSpace/Length.lean and Topology/MetricSpace/Length.lean - and some minor changes to other files. As far as I can tell, these do not yet exist in Mathlib.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear feedback on this idea and am happy to share more details. If this makes sense as a feature, I was wondering if I could have access to a non-master branch to implement this (my GitHub username is E-M-Bailey).</p>",
