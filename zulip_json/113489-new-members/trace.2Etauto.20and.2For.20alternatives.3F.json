I thought if I set it to true and placed the point over an invocation of <code>tauto</code> it would provide some kind of output as to what the tactic did. However, nothing seems to happen. I am using lean4-mode with Emacs 27.1. My main desire was to find out if my theorems relied on any classical reasoning, and whilst I have since found out I can use <code>#print axioms my_thm</code> for that purpose, I'd like to know if I can trace the innards of tauto regardless.</p>",
