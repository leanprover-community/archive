I'm a grad student in pure math, and my background is in number theory, representation theory, and more specifically what people call the Langlands program (though that is a pretty broad term nowadays). I recently learnt about Lean and have been pretty hooked ever since. My wish is to contribute in such a way that research mathematicians can one day express many of their ideas using Lean, and the progress here has been very exciting indeed!</p>",
