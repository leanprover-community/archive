I am Paul Chavez and I'm working on formalizing framework-independent zero divisor patterns that exhibit dimensional persistence from 16D sedenions to 256D.</p>\n<p>I have identified six patterns that can be calculated in both Cayley-Dickson and Clifford algebras in 16D that I am calling the 'Canonical Six' because the same patterns exist in 32D, 64D, 128D and 256D. I have a preliminary Lean 4 formalization via Harmonic Math's Aristotle and am looking to optimize it for potential mathlib compatibility.</p>\n<p>Zenodo record for reference: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17574868\">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17574868</a></p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Assuming this is what you did, I really don't think it's notable, or Mathlib worthy. First of all, the specific bases that you get out of applying the Cayley-Dickson construction are far from unique, and these structures have many automorphisms, meaning that the exact indices bear little significance. But also, the nature of the Cayley-Dickson construction means that each algebra embeds cleanly into the next: e_1 through e_16 in the 16-nions are the same as e_1 through e_16 in the 32-ions, etc. So it's not surprising that these equations hold across all of these.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Violeta,</p>\n<p>Thanks for engaging! I think my intro wasn't clear and there's been a misunderstanding about the core claim. The core claim isn't about patterns within Cayley-Dickson algebras alone.</p>\n<p>You're absolutely right that finding zero divisor patterns purely in CD wouldn't be notable - automorphisms and embedding structure would explain dimensional persistence there.</p>\n<p><strong>The key finding is </strong>framework independence**:</p>\n<p>I identified 12 zero divisor patterns in Cayley-Dickson sedenions (CD4). When I tested these same index patterns in Clifford algebras:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 patterns produce zero divisors in BOTH frameworks</li>\n<li>6 patterns work in Cayley-Dickson but provably FAIL in Clifford</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are fundamentally different algebraic structures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cayley-Dickson: e_i² = -1, non-associative</li>\n<li>Clifford: e_i² = +1, associative</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yet 6 patterns transcend this - same indices, same zero products, different multiplication rules.</p>\n<p>The dimensional persistence within CD (which you correctly note isn't surprising) extends to Clifford: the same 6 patterns also work in Cl(4,0) and Cl(5,0).</p>\n<p>Aristotle formalized this in Lean 4 (822 lines) - proving the patterns work in both CD4 and Cl(4,0), and that the CD-specific patterns fail in Clifford.</p>\n<p>This cross-framework structure is what I'm calling \"framework independence.\"</p>\n<p>Does this clarify? I'm curious if you see mathematical significance in patterns that transcend construction methods this way, or if there's something I'm missing about why this would be expected.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Paul</p>",
