        "content": "<p>Dear all, I am struggling to work with continuous multilinear maps. Sorry for the long block of code below but one of the problems I am having is that when typing the \\up symbol in a new file it will not compile so the only way I know how to get it to appear is in the problem I'm trying to solve. I did shorten the code by changing the goal. The new goal is of course in general false but it is the open 'work_on_goal 2' that I am struggling to close at the moment. I have been trying to close it by first using rw help, but this comes up with an error even though the objects appear to be the same. Any help is much appreciated.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span

The \"I\" tactics explicitly add stuff to the \"instance cache\" (the big list which the type class inference system looks at), so I used the <code>haveI</code> tactic to put a term of that type into the instance cache and then the function application worked.</p>",
