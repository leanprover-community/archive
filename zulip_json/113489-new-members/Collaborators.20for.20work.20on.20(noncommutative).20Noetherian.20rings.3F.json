I'm keen to contribute to mathlib but am feeling a significant gap between my current abilities and being able to formalize results in my research niche, so would like to contribute some time on more well-known (and potentially useful-to-other-people) things as a way to upskill.</p>\n<p>My research area is noncommutative geometry (but very much at the algebraic/categorical end) [<a href=\"http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~grabowsj/\">http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~grabowsj/</a>] so a natural starting point for me would be to look at fundamentals of (not necessarily commutative) Noetherian rings.  In particular, I'd be interested in formalizing the contents of (at least parts of) Goodearl-Warfield's \"An Introduction to Noncommutative Noetherian Rings\" [<a href=\"https://zbmath.org/1101.16001\">https://zbmath.org/1101.16001</a>].</p>\n<p>I don't feel very confident in being able to do this by myself, though, so would like to ask if anyone would be interested in collaborating on this as a \"small project\"?  If you would be, that'd be great - I'm contactable via here or various methods on my website.  </p>\n<p>[Edit:] Thanks,</p>\n<p>Jan</p>",

Do you think you are up to such a task? Stating theorems is quite a different task from proving them and not always easy, which is why I think it might be a good project -- it might teach you some useful things.</p>",

That is, a moderate amount of section 2 of loc. cit.  It would make sense to have the fundamental lemmata on Noetherian rings first, cf. section 1 of loc. cit.</p>\n<p>[* I can see there might be mixed views on this \"and\", in that it seems to me that mathlib aims more at general theorems than theorems about specific examples - perhaps I've got the wrong end of this stick, as a newbie, so I'm happy to be corrected.

The assertion that the integers are a Euclidean domain is not actually a theorem because it contains some data (basically the well-founded norm function being used). All the machinery is there to formalize any mathematical proof you want of Noetherianness of Z so you can make it as easy or as hard as you like.</p>",
