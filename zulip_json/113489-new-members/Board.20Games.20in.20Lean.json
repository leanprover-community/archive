My background is in mathematics (homological algebra), but I've been enjoying working on applications of Lean outside math. I modeled the board game Clue in Lean as a demonstration. For any interested, the formalization is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/hhboorstein/ClueLean\">https://github.com/hhboorstein/ClueLean</a>. Included is both the codified ruleset, entity types, and a gameplay ledger with deductions (I lost the game by one turn <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span>).</p>\n<p>I'm left with two lingering thoughts that I hope the community could nudge me on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What board game should I work on next? I'm enjoying these capsule projects that force me to stretch beyond mathematics. The goal is to work toward projects with serious business applications. I'm inspired, e.g., by the Lean implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/cedar-policy\">Cedar</a>.</li>\n<li>In writing a project without Mathlib, I sorely missed my beloved <code>apply at</code> tactic. Appreciating that there are roadmap considerations for core Lean, how could I start exploring contributing this tactic to either the core library or batteries? Is this a normal request? I've read through the contribution guidelines as a start, and I certainly would take this project slowly and deliberately, likely pairing with someone more experienced in metaprogramming. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Excited to be part of the community!</p>",

It has lots of simple board games and puzzles which you might try. That is if your aim is to try and write an AI solver(?)</p>\n<p>Can you say more about how your project works?</p>\n<p>I can see two main ways to encode games in Lean. My preference would be to encode the game states as dependent types. e.g. a tic-tac-toe board might be <code>State(1,0,0,-1,0,1,1,1,-1):Type</code> . And then a move to place an X in top right would be of type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">MoveXTR</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ForAll</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">State</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span><span class=\"n\">State</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Composing the different moves together would be a game and then you might need some type equality between the final state and the win-condition. An AI which solved the game would then by a tactic e.g.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Exists</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">State</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">and</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">((</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">and</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">and</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">or</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">....</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"k\">by</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">MyTicTacToeTactic</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But this would only prove such a win was possible not that it is the best win using minimax etc. Well that would be the pure mathematical way of doing things I think but maybe not the best if you just want to make a fun game playing program.</p>\n<p>These are just some food for thought.
