I already have lean4 installed and working. </p>\n<p>I'm trying  to follow the install instructions located on the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode?tab=readme-ov-file#installation\">github</a>.   But the instructions seem to presuppose that I have already downloaded some package. It thinks I already have \"/path/to/lean4-mode\". Where is that package supposed to come from? My guess is its the package in the github. But the documentation doesn't seem to specify and I wan't to confirm I have the right version.</p>",
