For instance, I have a simple PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/23986\">#23986</a>.</p>\n<p>My PR seems to be working fine. However, from what I understand, a PR usually needs to be approved by multiple reviewers before it can merged into the main branch. But I don't see an indicator on th PR page, like <code>(0 / n)</code>, for the number of completed reviews. Does anyone know what the current situation is after the PR process was updated?</p>",
