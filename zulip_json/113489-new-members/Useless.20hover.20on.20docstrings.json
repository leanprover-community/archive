But I always get a docstring telling me that you can add docstrings. That's cool I guess! But it's useless after the first time you see it.</p>\n<p>In general, it feels weird that some bit of internal naming (<code>declModifiers</code> in this case) shows up in this case. I can understand why this happens (Lean is super extensible, and docstring support itself is probably tacked onto it somewhere, and I'm looking at the docs for the part that defines this syntax, which happens to be called <code>declModifiers</code>). But if I wear my \"Lean user\" hat, this feels like something internal peeking through.</p>",
