So far we proved the correspondence for addition, unsigned less than, multiplication, negation etc...<br>\nI'd like to PR this to mathlib in steps. I'll start with unsigned less than and addition (i.e. the first 173 lines of the first link). My github is mhk119.<br>\nSee <a href=\"https://github.com/mhk119/lean-smt/blob/bitvec/Smt/Data/Bitwise.lean\">https://github.com/mhk119/lean-smt/blob/bitvec/Smt/Data/Bitwise.lean</a>.<br>\n(I'm putting this here for context <a href=\"https://github.com/mhk119/lean-smt/blob/bitvec/Smt/Data/BitVec.lean\">https://github.com/mhk119/lean-smt/blob/bitvec/Smt/Data/BitVec.lean</a> but I'm interested in PR-ing the former.)<br>\nHow do I initiate the process and is it ok to PR to mathlib4 now?</p>",
