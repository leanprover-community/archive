I'm not really experienced in VS Code or NeoVim, but I'm pretty comfortable in Vim, which I used without too much advanced configuration. But I'm mainly a math student,I barely ever program. I also use Parabola GNU/Linux, and I prefer to use free software so I would like to learn Lean in nvim rather than VS Code (which also seems to be hard to install in my Linux distro anyway). Following the Arch wiki, I installed elan and then install stable Lean 4. Now I'm a bit struggling to install the lean plugin for nvim. I don't have yet a configuration file for nvim as I  never used it before (I only used vim for a few years). Could someone help me creating a configuration file for nvim and installing the plugin for lean?</p>",
