While there is some special handling for non-dense orders like <code>Nat</code> and <code>Int</code>,<br>\nthis tactic is not complete for these theories and will not prove every true goal. It will solve<br>\ngoals over arbitrary types that instantiate <code>LinearOrderedCommRing</code>.</p>\n<p>An example:</p>\n<p><div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">example</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ℚ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h2</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h3</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">12</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">False</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kd\">by</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">linarith</span>\n</code></pre></div><br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
