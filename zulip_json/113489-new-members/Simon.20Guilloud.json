I led the development of a home made/experimental proof assistant, and hope to learn some more Lean and try to contribute to mathlib.</p>\n<p>I aim for developing the theory of ortholattices, which I believe are not defined in mathlib, and in particular the decidability of the word problem for ortholattices (and incidentally for lattices) which I have already formalized in Rocq. At the moment I am a bit lost in the jungle of type classes in the theory of orders and lattices and the various ways they are defined, so I'll just read the Lean references for a little while and then probably will ask a few questions!</p>\n<p>Bests,</p>\n<p>Simon</p>",
