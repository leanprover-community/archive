I've been teaching engineering students for 25 years, my research interests are mainly in modeling and simulation.</p>\n<p>I've found the development of proof assistants very interesting for a while, but  the learning curve was to steep for a \"hobby\". This might change now and I'm looking for applications in my areas of interest.</p>\n<p>To get started, I'm trying to formalize a few basic examples from a course on \"mathematics for engineers\". The Lean documentation - especially the  \"Math in Lean\" book - is very helpful, but sometimes I am completely stuck and will surely come here for helpful advice. I'm not quite sure, which channel to use for that, but the beginner's channel is hopefully a good start.</p>\n<p>I'm eager to meet you folks and send greetings from northern Germany<br>\n             Peter</p>",
