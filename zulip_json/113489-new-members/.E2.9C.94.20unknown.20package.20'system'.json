That's why, I was trying to find one which taught me the introduction. Most visible tutorial for lean is the \"Imperial College\" notes on Lean. Unfortunately, not very useful as their teaching audience does not seem to be clear. Whether they're referring individuals with no-knowledge of lean/a surface knowledge understanding individuals. </p>\n<p>And different Lean notes are more up on Google Search than the actual Lean4 documentation.</p>",
