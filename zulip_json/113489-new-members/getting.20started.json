Currently there is a steady stream of people who want to learn Lean for math. This is great but the self-teaching material that exists is not yet up to this task. As a kind of urgency plaster, I translated the exercises from my first year undergraduate course where I used Lean, simply adding a couple of tactics that allow more efficiency. The course was not about learning Lean, it was about learning how to write rigorous proofs. So it stops very far from the point where you can develop new maths in Lean, and it very carefully avoid painful points, like handling inclusion maps. I simply hoped it would keep people busy for some time, and teach useful stuff while we work on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean</a> that should ultimately contain much more.</p>",

I played a bit creating projects and I realise I have used almost a GB for nothing. Not a big deal, per se, just seems a bit odd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not a stupid question at all. Each time you create a new project, you download mathlib, with its full git history. That's about 37Mo. Then, if you don't already have them, you download <em>compiled</em> mathlib files. After unpacking, this adds about 80 Mo. If you already have those compiled files they are not downloaded but they are copied to your new project folder, which now weights about 120 Mo. This makes sense when you have a couple of projects that depend on different versions of mathlib, that you want to update independently (mathlib moves really fast, and a mathlib update can break your project non-trivially). But it doesn't make sense if you simply want to play with creating Lean projects. There are ways to improve on this, but limited time resources to modify leanproject. The current workflow works nicely for serious users who have a handful of projects that need to be really independent, and for people who want to play with one toy project.

I played a bit creating projects and I realise I have used almost a GB for nothing. Not a big deal, per se, just seems a bit odd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not a stupid question at all. Each time you create a new project, you download mathlib, with its full git history. That's about 37Mo. Then, if you don't already have them, you download <em>compiled</em> mathlib files. After unpacking, this adds about 80 Mo. If you already have those compiled files they are not downloaded but they are copied to your new project folder, which now weights about 120 Mo. This makes sense when you have a couple of projects that depend on different versions of mathlib, that you want to update independently (mathlib moves really fast, and a mathlib update can break your project non-trivially). But it doesn't make sense if you simply want to play with creating Lean projects. There are ways to improve on this, but limited time resources to modify leanproject. The current workflow works nicely for serious users who have a handful of projects that need to be really independent, and for people who want to play with one toy project. So improving this is very low priority. But feel free to contribute if fixing this is important to you. This is much much easier than proving things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks, this makes everything much clearer. I now really need to start making my hands dirty with some proof, but I'll be back to the forum as soon as I have more questions or comments. I think that this issue of dowloading 120 MB really not crucial for the time being.</p>",
