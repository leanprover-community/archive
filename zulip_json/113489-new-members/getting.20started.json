        "content": "<p>Hello. Windows user here.</p>\n<p>I've gotten Lean up and running already with VS Code. Because I had no idea ahead of time that the plugin would offer to install Lean itself, rather than letting the plugin install <code>elan</code>, I got the binaries ahead of time and pointed the plugin at it instead. So that is all fine and good.</p>\n<p>However, I am having difficulty figuring out how to install the Lean mathlib. Yes, I know that there are install instructions here: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md</a>. However, I am reluctant to go all the way with them for the following reasons.</p>\n<p>All the installation instructions are essentially messing around with a Linux shell that I am not familiar with. I am somewhat familiar with the Windows Powershell, but now with the Bash shell and I have no idea what most of these commands do.</p>\n<p>To show why this is an issue...suppose I open that Git Bash shell and run <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kha/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh</code>. Will this install <code>elan</code> somewhere even though I already have Lean installed? If I do not do this, will it break one of the future steps?</p>\n<p>Then the instructions say to install Python. I already have several Python 3 versions in my system (such as from Visual Studio's Anaconda install), and do not want to add any more to PATH. Right now the one that I have in PATH is 2.7 which is linked to Emacs. If I change that to 3.7 will it break the Emacs installation?</p>\n<p>At any rate, what I wrote is moot as running <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/remote-install-update-mathlib.sh -sSf | bash</code> which I anticipate should get the compiled library and put it I-do-not-know-where fails. Even if I put one of the Python 3 version into PATH, it fails to detect it from the shell, offers to install it and when I agree runs into issues with Chocolatey (which is kind of like <code>apt-get</code> for Windows) and aborts after too many errors. At first it asks me to go into administrator mode, but fails from there too with a huge pileup of text. I could paste it here, but I do not think that would get us anywhere constructive.</p>\n<p>I'd like to have some clear instruction on how to install the library starting with cloning the repo and moving from there. I hate the Linux style of installation where I am forced to mess with configuration files by hand and playing around with weird commands. Every time I tried something like that it has been an incredible waste of time to get the tools to work as it is now.</p>\n<p>I already tried just separating the folders inside <code>src</code> from the rest and putting them into the <code>LEAN_PATH</code> environment variable, but that is not working for me even though it seems them in autocomplete. It keeps looking for the <code>init</code> file and there are some errors with line endings apparently.</p>\n<p>What should I do here?</p>",

I'm sure that we would be keen to hear about any breakage (and would fix the scripts if possible). You don't have to understand the command line incantations, you just have to do what you're told. You do this every time you click \"install this thing\" on Windows and it replies \"sure, type in your admin password and I'll sort it out\". Surely every time you install some other software on Windows you don't ask exactly what it is doing? You will have to engage with the command line here, every time you clone a lean project from github you will have to type some incantations on the command line to make the project download the correct version of mathlib and then download all the binary mathlib files which mean you don't have to spend 15 minutes with your CPU on 100% while it compiles. An uncompiled mathlib is very painful. You don't just \"download mathlib\", that's not how it works. You work on a project, and the project has its own mathlib, and this mathlib needs to be compiled or it is painful. That's what all the magic incantations will make easy.</p>",

First who do you think are \"devs\" here? Do you mean the creator of Lean? He is a scholar engaged in a ten years research project,  and he wrote <em>everywhere</em> that Lean is not ready for unadventurous users. Taking care of users has never been his job, and it will probably never be. You can have a look at <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/\">https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/</a> for instance, and the FAQ linked there. </p>\n<p>Then there is the user community which you can meet here, and maintains everything at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/</a>, in particular <code>mathlib</code>. We do think Lean is already very nice to use, and we try to help people doing so. There are two kinds of users that are easy to help. Clueless users who blindly follows the instructions, and it works. Power users won't follow any instructions but will read the source code of scripts that clueless users are instructed to run, understand what they do, and do whatever they want (including compiling Lean itself from sources). This also work. Clueless users that refuse to follow instructions are much harder to help, especially when they use an exotic OS. </p>\n<p>That being said, we still have a lot of work to do to improve installation instructions. And I'm sure that Kevin and Mario are happy that they could help you. But complaining that it took too long to satisfy you is probably not the wisest thing to do.</p>",

Currently there is a steady stream of people who want to learn Lean for math. This is great but the self-teaching material that exists is not yet up to this task. As a kind of urgency plaster, I translated the exercises from my first year undergraduate course where I used Lean, simply adding a couple of tactics that allow more efficiency. The course was not about learning Lean, it was about learning how to write rigorous proofs. So it stops very far from the point where you can develop new maths in Lean, and it very carefully avoid painful points, like handling inclusion maps. I simply hoped it would keep people busy for some time, and teach useful stuff while we work on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean</a> that should ultimately contain much more.</p>",

Each time you create a new project, you download mathlib, with its full git history. That's about 37Mo. Then, if you don't already have them, you download <em>compiled</em> mathlib files. After unpacking, this adds about 80 Mo. If you already have those compiled files they are not downloaded but they are copied to your new project folder, which now weights about 120 Mo. This makes sense when you have a couple of projects that depend on different versions of mathlib, that you want to update independently (mathlib moves really fast, and a mathlib update can break your project non-trivially). But it doesn't make sense if you simply want to play with creating Lean projects. There are ways to improve on this, but limited time resources to modify leanproject. The current workflow works nicely for serious users who have a handful of projects that need to be really independent, and for people who want to play with one toy project. So improving this is very low priority. But feel free to contribute if fixing this is important to you. This is much much easier than proving things.</p>",

So the user can't edit the statement, but  when they want to copy, they can select all of it. Unfortunately, monaco-editor, which is used in the NNG and other places with Lean on the web, doesn't have this option. One way to go around it would be to use another text editor, like Ace editor, which has this function. But that seems to be very difficult. I would need to redefine the Lean syntax and autocompletion and highlighting and everything for a new editor. Besides, this seems to be the only way Ace editor is better. Monaco editor is the web-based version of VS code, which is why things work so well.</p>",

I remember thinking that monaco would be too heavy-weight (in terms of file-size) to include, and it also looked to be a lot of work to bundle it properly for my use-case. In the end it wasn't too hard to write a Lean integration for CodeMirror following what was already done for monaco in the lean-web-editor, since the CodeMirror API is fairly simple.</p>",
