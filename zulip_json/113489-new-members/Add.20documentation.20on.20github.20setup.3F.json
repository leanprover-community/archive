Would it be possible to add documentation on <a href=\"http://lean-lang.org\">lean-lang.org</a> or <a href=\"http://leanprover-community.github.io\">leanprover-community.github.io</a> that specified standard procedures and things to look out for when putting a new Lean repo on github?  If someone suggests an appropriate place, I'll try to add text on what I know, but I don't know all I need to know.
