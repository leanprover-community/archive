I see there's some algebraic number theory: definition of algebraic number fields, special stuff on Z[sqrt(d)] and Gaussian integers, and some class number stuff. But I couldn't find any actual \"meat\" of the theory, e.g. I couldn't even find a proof of what the integral closure of Z in Q[sqrt(d)] was. Is there somewhere and I'm missing it?</p>",

So the topics you mention would be great to have soon, and I'm more than happy to help you with that.
