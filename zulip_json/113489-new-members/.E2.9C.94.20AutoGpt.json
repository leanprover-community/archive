Find out the status of Yitang Zhang's paper \"Discrete mean estimates and the Landau-Siegel zero\".<br>\nAnswer : <br>\nThe paper “Discrete mean estimates and the Landau-Siegel zero” by Yitang Zhang is a preprint that was submitted to arXiv on 4 Nov 202212. It claims to prove the Landau-Siegel zeros conjecture, which is a long-standing problem in number theory related to the distribution of zeros of Dirichlet L-functions13. The paper is 111 pages long and consists of 18 sections45. It has not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal yet, so its validity and impact are still uncertain.</p>\n<p>Q. search latest update on it and explaine in detaile<br>\nAnswer : <br>\nAccording to the search results, there is no official update on the paper since it was submitted to arXiv on 4 Nov 2022¹²⁴. However, some news articles and online discussions have reported on the paper and its significance³⁵. Here is a brief summary of the paper and its main idea:</p>\n<p>The paper aims to prove the Landau-Siegel zeros conjecture, which states that for any real primitive character χ to the modulus D, the Dirichlet L-function L(s, χ) does not vanish near s = 1, except possibly at a single real zero ρ satisfying |ρ - 1| &lt; c0(log D)^-1 for some absolute constant c0. This conjecture is one of the major open problems in analytic number theory, as it has implications for the distribution of prime numbers, the class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields, and the abc conjecture.</p>\n<p>The main result of the paper is that for any real primitive character χ to the modulus D, L(1, χ) &gt; c1(log D)^-2022 for some absolute and effectively computable constant c1. This implies that L(s, χ) does not vanish for s &gt; 1 - c2(log D)^-2024 for some absolute and effectively computable constant c2. This result improves on the previous best known bound of L(1, χ) &gt; C1(ε)D^-ε for any ε &gt; 0 by Siegel, which was ineffective and did not rule out the possibility of a Landau-Siegel zero.</p>\n<p>The main idea of the proof is to relate the lower bound for L(1, χ) to the distribution of zeros of a family of Dirichlet L-functions L(s, ψχ) in a certain region Ω, where ψ runs over a set of characters Ψ1. The author uses some results on the gaps between consecutive zeros of L(s, ψχ) to show that if L(1, χ) is too small, then there are too many zeros in Ω. Then, by evaluating certain discrete means of the large sieve type involving ψ and χ, the author obtains a contradiction. The proof involves many technical lemmas and calculations involving Euler products, arithmetic sums, and complex analysis.</p>\n<p>Source: Conversation with Bing, 26/4/2023<br>\n(1) [2211.02515] Discrete mean estimates and the Landau-Siegel zero. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515</a>.<br>\n(2) Discrete mean estimates and the Landau-Siegel zero. <a href=\"https://arxiv-export1.library.cornell.edu/pdf/2211.02515\">https://arxiv-export1.library.cornell.edu/pdf/2211.02515</a>.<br>\n(3) Title: Discrete mean estimates and the Landau-Siegel zero. <a href=\"https://arxiv-export1.library.cornell.edu/abs/2211.02515\">https://arxiv-export1.library.cornell.edu/abs/2211.02515</a>.<br>\n(4) Chinese-American Mathematician Yitang Zhang Publishes Paper on Landau .... <a href=\"https://pandaily.com/chinese-american-mathematician-yitang-zhang-publishes-paper-on-landau-siegel-zeros-conjecture/\">https://pandaily.com/chinese-american-mathematician-yitang-zhang-publishes-paper-on-landau-siegel-zeros-conjecture/</a>.<br>\n(5) Philosophy behind Zhang's 2022 preprint on the Landau–Siegel zero. <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/434583/philosophy-behind-zhangs-2022-preprint-on-the-landau-siegel-zero\">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/434583/philosophy-behind-zhangs-2022-preprint-on-the-landau-siegel-zero</a>.</p>",
