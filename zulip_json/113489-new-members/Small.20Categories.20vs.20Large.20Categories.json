I'm currently doing a proof on the uniqueness of identity morphisms in a category, but I saw that I can use either large or small categories depending on if I want my morphisms to live in separate universes. Is this kind of preference/organization, or will I just learn over time the merits of choosing small or large?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
