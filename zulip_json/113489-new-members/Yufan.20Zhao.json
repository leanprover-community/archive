I have been trying to improve the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs, and since last month I've been trying to do it for Math reasoning.</p>\n<p>Right now I am looking at the DeekSeek Prover paper (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14333\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14333</a>) and the miniF2F dataset. At the very last page of the paper in appendix A.4, there is a massive list of import packages that I think contains all possible packages needed for miniF2F. Importing this list of packages manually reduces the burden on LLMs. However, copy-pasting that list gives many \"file not found errors\". </p>\n<p>I suspect the reason is that there has been some refactoring and reorganization in mathLib since the DeepSeek Prover people did their experiments. For example, there is a:</p>\n<p>import Mathlib.Algebra.GroupPower.Basic</p>\n<p>but that file is not there anymore:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/master/Mathlib/Algebra/GroupPower\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/master/Mathlib/Algebra/GroupPower</a></p>\n<p>Is there anywhere I can find these refactoring and reorganization changes?</p>",
