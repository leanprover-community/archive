Tbh I don't fully understand how the import and namespacing convention works, I thought in an import statement the last leg is the namespace you import and have access to? So <code>import Std.Data.HashMap</code> would give me access to the <code>HashMap</code> namespace, but it gives me access to the <code>Std.HashMap</code> namespace?</p>",
