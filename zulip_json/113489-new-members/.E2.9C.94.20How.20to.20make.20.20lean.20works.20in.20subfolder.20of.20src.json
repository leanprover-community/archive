However after I created a subfolder under <code>./src</code> ,namely <code>./src/basic</code>, and created a lean file there, it cannot work properly. Keywords <code>import</code>, <code>def</code> does not turn highlighted and lean info window doesn't show anything. How can I make things work? Thanks!</p>",
