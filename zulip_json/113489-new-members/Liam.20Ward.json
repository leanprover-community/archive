        "content": "<p>Hello all — I’m Liam, an independent mathematician based in the UK. My main interests are in analysis and operator semigroups, particularly how semigroup evolution interacts with function spaces such as Paley–Wiener spaces, sampling sets, and frame-type structures. I’ve recently had my first paper sent out for peer review, which has encouraged me to get more involved with the wider mathematical community.</p>\n<p>I tend to work on fairly structural questions: stability under perturbation, quantitative bounds, and how analytic objects behave under dissipative or smoothing flows. I’m especially interested in results that come with explicit constants or inequalities, and in understanding these phenomena from both an abstract and a computational point of view.</p>\n<p>I’m new to Lean and to formalisation more generally, so for now I’m mostly here to learn — to see how people approach making analysis precise, and to get a better sense of where formal and classical viewpoints meet. Looking forward to learning from everyone here.</p>",
