In particular the way you find Binet's formula with Loogle is very much how I envisioned people to use it: don't bother getting the precise system right in the search, but just list two concepts that very likely are part of the statement (here fib and sqrt), as that often suffices.</p>\n<p>I noticed you didn't use loogle's ability to search by lemma name substring. I guess that's because moogle served you well to find how a concept is called in mathlib. It's a clever combination of the two very different searches.</p>\n<p>Having this kind of advice in a (more accessible) blog post would be great, thanks for writing that, Bolton!</p>",
