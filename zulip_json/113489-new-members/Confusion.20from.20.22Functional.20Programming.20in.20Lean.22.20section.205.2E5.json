Using Sort instead I have: <code>Type 1 -&gt; Type 2</code> which translates to Type 1 is in Sort 3, Type 2 is in Sort 4, with the function type in Sort (max 3 4) = Sort 4. Therefore the function type lives in universe Type 3.</p>\n<p>Is this correct? Sorry I'm being pedantic, but I've confused myself and AI to boot (which is always fun :-) ).</p>",
