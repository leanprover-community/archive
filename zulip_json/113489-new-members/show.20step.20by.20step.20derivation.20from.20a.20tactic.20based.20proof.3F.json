This can help demystify the tactic based proofs for the beginner to whom the tactic looks like a black(magic)box.</p>\n<p>thanks for your help,<br>\nKrishna</p>",

A not very helpful way to do what you want is to use <code>show_term</code> (or put a <code>?</code> after the <code>by</code>) which will print the actual proof term that has been constructed, but it is rarely easy to parse for humans. Unfortunately this is more or less the best you can do as far as I know</p>",
