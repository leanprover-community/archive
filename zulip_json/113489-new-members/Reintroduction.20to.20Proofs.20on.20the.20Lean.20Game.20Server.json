Following a suggestion made by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span> this past summer, there is a world studying constructions involving the empty type before introducing negations, which allows us to separate out constructive proofs (eg double negation introduction) from classical ones (such as double negation elimination).</p>\n<p>This was made possible by the good folks who built the Lean Game Skeleton repository and answered questions on the Lean for teaching thread, such as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"252920\">@Alex Kontorovich</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"816344\">@Aaron Liu</span>,  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"453098\">@Dan Velleman</span>. In particular, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"385895\">@Jon Eugster</span> saved me several times, when I needed help in a rush before my text class. </p>\n<p>After the semester ended, I reordered several of the worlds and made various edits and additions. Further contributions are very welcome, especially in the form of PRs to <a href=\"https://github.com/emilyriehl/ReintroductionToProofs\">this repository</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>For those who want to contribute, here are some things I know could use more attention:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The library, which is a bit weirdly structured. Most of the stuff that's included as definitions or theorems actually comes from mathlib, rather than theorems proven in the levels (the exception being most of Advanced Function World). Was this the right call? I'm not sure. On the one hand, it seemed nicer to avoid clutter of stuff that isn't necessary. But it could certainly be made more robust and be better structured.</li>\n<li>The Boss Levels are a bit uneven. A few are really great, like the <a href=\"https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/emilyriehl/ReintroductionToProofs/world/FunctionWorld/level/10\">Boss Level of Function World</a>. But others are either boring or a bit too easy. Suggestions would be very welcome.</li>\n<li>The final Dependent World is a bit stubby (written hastily at the very last minute). I'd love to include some better examples of dependent types over the booleans or the naturals, but I don't want to depart too much from how things are handled in Mathlib. I thought about including something like <code>Fin</code> but redefined to be an iterated coproduct of the the unit type and perhaps reindexed so that the type family has a section. But this felt a bit complicated so I left it out.</li>\n</ol>",
