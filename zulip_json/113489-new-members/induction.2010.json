In that case, use your \"superpower\" of the things you already know and prove it that way.  At the end of the day you'll know more whether you \"cheat\" or not and if you want to formalise harder stuff you will have access to the full power/knowledge of mathlib anyways. I think that those tutorials are mostly used to get one acquainted to entry level stuff. It would be silly if one could use the more overpowered tactics for those facts that are solved by a one liner.</p>\n<p>Pedagogically it is helpful to know how to solve a problem when the big guns fail. I, for example, loved the natural number game. It was a very good introduction to tactics, exact, have, ring,....</p>",
