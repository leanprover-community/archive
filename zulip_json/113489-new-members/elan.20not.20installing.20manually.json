There are reasons for me not to use VSCode, thus I opted for a manual installation as in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html</a>. On <code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -f elan-init.ps1</code> there are several errors like 'Missing file specification after redirection operator' and 'Unexpected token '}' in the expression or statement'. Is my device at fault?</p>",
