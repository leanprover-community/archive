I wish to continue learning and using Lean and to create my own math projects. </p>\n<p>I have several questions about difficulties that I've faced with learning Lean 4 on my own.</p>\n<p>1) I have permanent troubles with installing mathlib for Lean 4. Following the instructions on Lean 4 website doesn't solve my problems. I need someone to help me, to show where my mistakes are. More details I can explain to the person who can help me (constant not-up-to-date mathlib with errors or problems with versions, toolchain, cache get, etc. during installation). </p>\n<p>2) Where and to whom can I address my questions related to Lean 4 / mathlib installation and development? I am interested in adding my results to category theory packages, once I'll be able to use mathlib.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Alexey Sorokin</p>",
