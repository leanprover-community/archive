(I don't have Intel Mac, but I heard that installing in this way did not succeed, so I guess people should follow instructions on <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html\">How to install Lean 4 on MacOS</a>?)</li>\n</ul>",

I tried the quickstart and it also worked fine for me, and I've been able to run the Mathematics in Lean tutorial. As far as I can tell everything is running natively. So this does seem to be the best way to get started on ARM Macs now--perhaps the documentation should be updated?</p>",
