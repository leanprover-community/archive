I would like to know to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Background: I'm doing research in autoformalization. I need my pipeline to get lean feedback quickly.</p>\n<p>I would like to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>can be implemented in code like bash or some hack on leanc</li>\n<li>as fast as possible, utilizing mathlib4 cache efficiently</li>\n<li>as simple as possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's what I've tried. It seems that each lean package stores its own copy of mathlib cache. So I set up a central package with mathlib4. And then each file is put under the package, although not imported by the main <code>Basic.lean</code>. <code>lake build</code> simply wouldn't work, because these small files are not imported by the main <code>Basic.lean</code>. Then I tried <code>lake lean</code>, which seems to often output irrelevant information like warnings in Mathlib4 docstrings which I totally don't want to see for my project.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking whether I need to go the trouble of using lean server for this purpose.</p>\n<p>What would you guys suggest? Thanks a lot in advance.</p>",
