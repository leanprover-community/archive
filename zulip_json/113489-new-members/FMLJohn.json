Here are some of the results we have formalized: for a commutative ring, its topological Krull dimension is the same as its ring-theoretical Krull dimension; if I is a prime ideal of a commutative ring R, then the height of I is equal to the Krull dimension of the localization of R with respect to I; the Krull dimension of a non-field PID is 1, etc. But most of what we have formalized have not been put into Mathlib 4 yet.</p>",
