I dipped my feet in Metamath which is a really simple system similar to Lean but unfortunately I don't know enough set theory for it (not yet at least). I also discovered Lean a couple months ago. I've done a the natural number game (It's really fun) until the power world and I'm just now starting the function world. I've heard that there is a discord, but I couldn't find an active invite link. Can I get one somehow? One more question: I've read that Lean4 is not backwards compatible with Lean3. Which one should I learn as a complete beginner?</p>",
