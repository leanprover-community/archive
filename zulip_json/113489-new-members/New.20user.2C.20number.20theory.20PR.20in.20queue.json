Things are moving so fast.  And thank you for the welcome.  I am aware of the PrimeNumberTheoremAnd effort but hadn't been following closely.</p>\n<p>My motivation right now is understanding how various equivalent forms of the PNT related to one another, and I thought this may be an interesting angle to dig into Lean.  It's possible to stay modest, as there are many \"easy\" equivalences, which is nice!</p>",
