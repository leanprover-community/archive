I was thinking that formalizing a counterexample from topology could be quite fun; one of my favorites is the \"long ray\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_line_(topology)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_line_(topology)</a>). However I'm already stuck at the very first step because I can't seem to figure out how to construct the first uncountable ordinal in Lean. I've skimmed the files about ordinal numbers in mathlib but couldn't find any useful information. Any hints would be much appreciated! :)</p>",
