I hope all's well with you.</p>\n<p>Concerning minimal sets, etc. I realised fairly recently that there is some stuff in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Dynamics/Minimal.html\">Dynamics/Minimal</a> and so we should try to match with that and no duplicate. I have some extra pieces, for existence the proof of the existence of minimal sets using Zorn's lemma, etc but I still have them in a <a href=\"https://github.com/oliver-butterley/birkhoff/blob/wip-exist-minimal/BET/Topological.lean\">branch of a fork of BET</a>.</p>\n<p>I know, this is ridiculous of me, I should have merged everything properly a few months ago so that it was easier for everyone to see what is what. However that was just the moment my partner returned to work after maternity leave and our son didn't start in the nursery until a few months later. So I had a few months of playing, not sleeping and failing to do sensible organization of code! </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"556875\">@Pietro Monticone</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"638899\">@Lorenzo Luccioli</span>, you guys are efficient! Sorry if my lack of organization at the moment has been an inconvenience. Let me figure out a way to put all of your stuff together. But then we probably need to find what we need to modify to fit with what's already in mathlib.</p>\n<p>I like Damien's suggestion, we can keep the repo as more or less good and complete, in preparation for moving to mathlib but be a bit more relaxed about our standards. From this week onwards I finally have time to work again and I'm happy to use time on this.</p>",
