Maybe the right approach here is to consider a <code>LinearIsometryEquiv</code> which performs the rotation by <code>π/4</code>. This will preserve <code>convexHulls</code> because its linear, and volumes (on the <code>EuclideanSpace ℝ 2</code>) via <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=LinearIsometryEquiv.measurePreserving#doc\">docs#LinearIsometryEquiv.measurePreserving</a>. Then you can show that the (rotated) convex hull is equal to <code>Icc (-√2) √2 ×ˢ Icc (-√2) √2</code> from which you can easily compute the measure (here <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=PiLp.volume_preserving_equiv#doc\">docs#PiLp.volume_preserving_equiv</a> will be helpful, along with <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MeasureTheory.Measure.volume_prod#doc\">docs#MeasureTheory.Measure.volume_prod</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MeasureTheory.Measure.prod_prod#doc\">docs#MeasureTheory.Measure.prod_prod</a>)</p>",
