Mostly I copied over just the top half of the file, and I have things like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">namespace</span> <span class=\"n\">Polynomial</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">coeffList</span> <span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span> <span class=\"n\">Polynomial</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>defined there. This worked fine when it was all one file. Now my new file can't seem to see any of the imports:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">DesRoS.auxiliary_defs</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">open</span> <span class=\"n\">Polynomial</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">namespace</span> <span class=\"n\">DesRoS</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>all looks fine, but then if I try to refer to <code>coeffList</code>, or even <code>Polynomial.coeffList</code>, it can't find it.</p>\n<p>If I copy and paste the whole contents of <code>auxiliary_defs.lean</code> over the line <code>import DesRoS.auxiliary_defs</code>, it then works. My understand was that <code>import</code> should basically just load that file 'as if' it had been pasted in. Any idea how to fix?</p>",
