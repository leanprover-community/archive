I was curious about if there's a design philosophy-related reason as to why random variables are not a type in Mathlib.Probability? My understanding is that the default right now is to create a function and add the assumption that it is measurable, but I would have thought the benefits of being able to do this in one clause with something like </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">RandomVariable</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">\\</span><span class=\"n\">Omega</span><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>might be substantial if there are sufficiently many random variables.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
