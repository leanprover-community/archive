We have a <a href=\"https://github.com/provables/special-numbers\">git repository</a> with the code with the results in the file <a href=\"https://github.com/provables/special-numbers/blob/main/SpecialNumbers/Euclidian.lean\">Euclidean.lean</a> (and also some work in progress code about the Eulerian numbers). For a quick look, this is the <a href=\"https://provables.github.io/special-numbers/SpecialNumbers/Euclidian.html\">auto-generated documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>As this is our first real project with Lean, we'd greatly appreciate any feedback. Would some of these topics be a direction that we can follow for contributing to Mathlib? </p>\n<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>Tagging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"727207\">@Joe Stubbs</span></p>",

I think this work would be better suited in a different repo, for example an OEIS repo. My worry is that if we add this sequence then it opens a potential floodgate of people adding other OEIS sequences for no reason other than \"mathlib has some OEIS sequences\". </p>\n<p>Of course I would be happy to be overruled here and the comments above only reflect my personal opinion; I'm not speaking for the community or even the maintainers here. I think that an OEIS repo would be quite a cool thing, and one could even imagine linking to it from the OEIS itself. But <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20669\">#20669</a> came up in the triage meeting as it's been around for a while and perhaps we need to make a decision on it.</p>",
