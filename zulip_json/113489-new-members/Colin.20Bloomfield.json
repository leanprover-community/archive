I think I can make useful contributions in category theory, order theory, logic and algebra. </p>\n<p>I would like to get write access and hopefully I can start getting my feet wet my making some modest contributions in one of these areas. (E.g. I would love to make a simple edit and push it to get practice with the contributing workflow.)</p>\n<p>I welcome any advice and suggestions on how best to contribute and get up to speed. Thanks for your consideration.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nColin</p>",
