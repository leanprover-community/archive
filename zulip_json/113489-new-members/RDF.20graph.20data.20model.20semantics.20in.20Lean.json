        "content": "<p>Hello dear Lean community,</p>\n<p>It's a pleasure to join you. My name is Andrew, my main interest lies in communication protocols and ontologies for integration of systems (thus, it should be clear that I am not a mathematician). I am starting to use Lean and my current idea is to use Lean to prove a number of invariants on protocols and ontologies in a certain area that relies on RDF, a graph data model that was developed as part of the semantic web research.</p>\n<p>I would like to ask if anyone has modeled the semantics of RDF (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/\">https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/</a>) and/or Description Logic in Lean?  I am interested in it for three reasons: a reusable building block will help me get started faster, might help me develop my definitions in a way that could later be reused, and because RDF model is a bit peculiar. In particular, an <em>RDF resource</em> may be an instance of multiple classes, which means (as far as I understand) that RDF type model would have to be formalized in Lean without primary reliance on Lean type system. I would be very thankful for any useful pointers.</p>\n<p>Again, my pleasure to join the community and looking forward to stimulating discussions and helping each other (though I am likely going to be on the receiving side for a while, thus thank you in advance for your patience)!</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nAndrew</p>",
