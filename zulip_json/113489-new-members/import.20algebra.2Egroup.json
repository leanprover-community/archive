I've initialized my lean project and ensured mathlib is installed by using <code>leanproject new</code>. I have started VS code from within the folder. I think my leanpkg.path and leanpkg.toml, as well as my project structure looks good. I've also exported LEAN_PATH from my terminal to include both the mathlib src and the project src directory.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to reproduce the examples in this documentation page: <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/interacting_with_lean.html#using-the-library\">https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/interacting_with_lean.html#using-the-library</a></p>\n<p>It seems that there is no folder named _target/deps/mathlib/algebra/group in my project. Did something change from version to version? Thanks!</p>",
