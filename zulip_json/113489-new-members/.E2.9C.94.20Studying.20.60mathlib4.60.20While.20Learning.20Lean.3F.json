But mathlib4 seems highly interdependent, so I don't really know where to start.  Hence two questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Are there beginner friendly \"entry points\" to mathlib4, with not too many dependencies?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it possible to \"compile\" a given file so that all dependencies are included directly in the file, i.e.  creating a standalone file?  From what I understand, <code>.olean</code> files do something similar, but not in a human readable format.  So is it maybe possible to compile a human readable <code>.olean</code> file?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
