After some testing I found that even after i do <code>lake exe cache get</code>, when I open a file and do <code>import Mathlib</code> it ends up rebuilding the whole mathlib (which is much more time consuming than downloading the cache, which is what I am trying to avoid). My <code>lean-toolchain</code> for both my project and <code>lake-packages/mathlib</code> are <code>leanprover/lean4:nightly-2023-05-16</code>. Is there any way to avoid the rebuilding? I suspect it's something to do with the hashes of downloaded olean files not matching up or something. Perhaps the cache is lagging behind the github mathlib4?</p>\n<p>Edit: Fixed! To anyone that this might help, use <code>get!</code> instead of <code>get</code>. I don't know why this works but it does!</p>",
