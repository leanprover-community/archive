I've been using Lean 4 to formalize results from my paper \"The Intelligence Bound\" (Hart 2025), which establishes information-theoretic bounds connecting entropy, ecological complexity, and computational intelligence.</p>\n<p>I've just opened my first Mathlib PR — <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/35705\">#35705</a> — which extracts two general-purpose lemmas from that formalization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ENNReal.div_eq_div_mul_div</code>: division decomposition for extended non-negative reals</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><code>IndepFun.of_self</code>: if Y is independent of itself under a probability measure, then X and Y are independent<br>\nLooking forward to feedback and contributing more to the library!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
