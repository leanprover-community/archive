OK, trying that.  </p>\n<p>(The underlying problem I'm trying to solve is that sometimes I change something in a file I'm working on, and Lean gets stuck in \"Processing file ...\" even though I'm not loading libraries, and even though other changes didn't have this effect.  If I restart my editor, everything's fine with the saved file--so it's not that my code broke Lean. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>  That's what I was trying to solve by reinitializing Lean, the libraries, etc.  I haven't asked about it here because I couldn't identify the conditions under which Lean went off into space.  I'll be curious as to whether this change makes that problem go away.)</p>",
