I have access to mathlib3 but I'm getting ready to make some new PRs to mathlib4, on group actions. I'll start with pointwise stabilizers, but I'll also add <code>Subgroup.IsMaximal</code> <code>Subgroup.Normal.IsMaximal</code> <code>AddSubgroup.IsMaximal</code> (analogously to <code>Ideal.IsMaximal</code>) since I'll be using at least two of these further down the line. Could someone please invite me (GitHub handle <code>wupr</code>)?</p>",
