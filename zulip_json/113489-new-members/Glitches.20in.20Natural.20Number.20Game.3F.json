I realized the reason I was struggling was because I was using rw instead of apply and ended up misusing the notation to get what I needed. However, in the screenshot that I posted, I had finished the theorem since I could resolve all of the impossible cases with trivial, which shouldn't be possible? Either way, thank you guys for your help!</p>",
