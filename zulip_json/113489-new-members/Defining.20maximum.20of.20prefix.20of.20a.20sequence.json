Here you may have been able to guess the name by the fact that your operation is taking <code>max</code> of <code>s (n + 1)</code> with <code>max_prefix s n</code>. But then there's no need for it to be a <code>max</code> for that to be well-defined, so replace it with <code>⊔</code> (<code>sup</code>). Probably the name contains \"sup\". Then it's guesswork to find that it will have \"partial\" in the name.</p>",
