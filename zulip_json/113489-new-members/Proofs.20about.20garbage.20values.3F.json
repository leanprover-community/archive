This leads to a lot of \"theorems\" which aren't true in mathematics. How does one deal with that?</p>\n<p>One way is to accept that <code>Real.log</code> isn't the same as the logarithm function used in mathematics, <code>log 0 = 0 / 0 = 0</code> really holds and make all theorems as general as possible. Another way is to \"pretend\" that these functions are the same as in math and try to \"never divide by zero\". I think the second way is very hard to maintain (tactics would need to know this? Does that then defeat the purpose of formally verifying stuff?) and there are a lot of theorems in mathlib already which use the definitions as they are (e.g. unnecessary differentiability assumptions are omitted).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there seem to be theorems in Mathlib that could be generalized but weren't, perhaps due to not being \"true in math\".</p>\n<p>For example, I'm reasonably sure (my recent question on this didn't receive answers) that <code>Continuous fun x =&gt; x * Real.log x</code>. Is that something that could go into Mathlib if proven, or is it a \"bad theorem\"?</p>",

I don't quite understand. Are there \"evil theorems\" that typecheck but aren't \"true\" in some sense relevant to Mathlib and would be bad to include (I'm not talking about \"theorems that break tactics\" or \"trivial theorems that just clutter the code\")? Is it true to say that a theorem that's already in Mathlib should always be as general as possible (have the weakest possible assumptions)?</p>",
