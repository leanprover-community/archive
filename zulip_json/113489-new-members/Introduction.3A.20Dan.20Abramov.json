A few years ago I started going through Tao's Analysis book which I really liked because of how rigorous it was — it felt like I can really \"trust\" the definitions because nothing was hidden or implied. I got through a lot of exercises there but felt frustrated I can't \"run\" them the way I do with code.</p>\n<p>Recently, I've decided to try to pick up mathematics again, and Lean seemed like a natural way to do it. I'm worried that I'm not going to do well because of my missing mathematics background (I dropped out of uni on the first year) but I'm going to give it a fair try and see if it leads me anywhere. I'm currently going through the NNG (will probably finish today) and then planning to start Mathematics in Lean. </p>\n<p>In the longer run, I really would love if I could gain enough context to meaningfully contribute to digitizing mathematics or at least to Lean itself or the community tooling (like NNG itself). If there are any virtual study groups or anything of the sort where I can find peers who are at a similar journey, I'd appreciate pointers. Feel free to just say hi as well. Cheers.</p>",

If you want to write some more Natural Number Game then I have plenty of ideas :-) (e.g. we want a prime number world with the boss level being to prove that 2 is prime ;-) The hard part will be formally checking that 2 isn't something like 29385734958739857*459487694876, so we would need to use the theorems in inequality world and possibly add new ones (for example I'm not sure I proved a&lt;=ab if b&gt;=1, which will be crucial for proving 2 is prime). But if you'd appreciate something more serious then several people have had a crack at Tao's Analysis book in the past.</p>\n<p>In my experience, what works best to start with is that you formalise some mathematics which you already understand. This gives you some feeling as to how the language works, and when you've struggled through the proofs you triumphantly post them here and you'll find that  people in the community will just give you code review and by the end of it your proofs will be much shorter and more idiomatic.</p>",

I'm still a noob, so take this with a grain of salt, yet I feel compelled to offer a word of caution. The natural numbers games will not be enough. After going through the games, I highly recommend working through The Mechanics of Proof. But still, that  probably won't be enough. You might then do what I did and attack analysis. I bashed my way through the proofs up through lecture 6 of <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/\">(real analysis 18.100A)</a>, but realized it's just not the right way to do it because although it is possible to build things from the ground up, as we programmers like to do, it really is a mistake.  Why? Because formalization is an art in and of itself, and as far as I can tell the language used to organize Mathlib is abstract algebra. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span>'s course called Formalizing Mathematics is an intro to the art. I made it to the Normal Subgroups sheet before needing to retreat and now am working through a set of abstract algebra lectures on youtube. That is to say, I would recommend doing abstract algebra (knowing haskell will not suffice) before analysis because it will be easier to navigate Mathlib,  which is helpful when using Mathlib definitions, instead of using what seems like a good enough definition that merely works when learning the math, which might be rewarding, but probably won't generalize as well. (To conclude this cautionary note, because of my ignorance, I now need to go back and rework my proofs from those 6 lectures I mentioned earlier so they use Mathlib definitions)</p>",

In terms of what math to do I think \"follow what you end up being interested in as you learn or see more things\"; the nice thing about being in a degree program is you get a tour of the common subfields, but without such a thing, you just get to play and figure it out I suppose -- I do think that your original study group question is a good one to have asked because what can be frustrating is to bump into some mathematical structure you don't know about and trying to learn about it becomes this big annoying backtracking exercise to learn whatever prerequisites you're missing.

Stepping though existing proofs is much less helpful because it doesn't expose those gaps.</li>\n<li>It's not a great idea to learn new math at the same time as formalizing a result about it. If I'm stuck while formalizing and I <em>also</em> don't understand the mathematical argument, I get very demotivated. I've found it helpful to first gain intuition <em>about</em> the mathematical argument by drawing pictures. And then when the intuitive argument \"makes sense\", I try to formalize a strict written version of the argument. If I get stuck in formalization, I can fall back to the strict written version to pick it back up — and if I don't understand <em>that</em> — I can fall back to the intuitive picture to understand the argument.</li>\n<li>Unlike most programming I've done so far, it feels actually usefiul to break things down into smaller pieces before completing those. I.e. writing almost \"inside out\". For example, if I get stuck formalizing some detail, I can backtrack and formalize a sequence of \"larger\" steps with <code>sorry</code>s for each of them, and at least get <em>those</em> to click. So there's a lot of \"zooming in\" and \"zooming out\" that can be done at any point of the proof, and I don't have to approach it linearly.</li>\n<li>I find it helpful to keep my own cheat sheet of tactics.</li>\n<li>What's still hard: sometimes there's stuff that <em>feels</em> like it should be easy (\"I need to get rid of <code>/ 6</code> on two sides of this thing!\" or \"x divides y, but I need it to divide 3 * y\") but I spend unreasonable time on it. I'm getting better at this but just searching for the right lemma or figuring out the right way to \"plug it in\" is tedious. Hopefully I'll improve on this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I plan to keep going through MIL for now since I'm just about halfway through it. So far I enjoy its mix of theory and practical exercises.</p>",

I've been slacking off in the past week due to jetlag from moving (temporarily) to Japan, but am trying to pick up the pieces now.</p>\n<p>I made it through the Chapter 6 of MIL but found it increasingly boring. I'm not sure whether this has to do with the verbosity of defining structures, or whether it's the example itself (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C06_Structures.html#building-the-gaussian-integers\">Building the Guassian Integers</a>) that doesn't excite me. I'm mostly able to follow along the explanations but I feel too \"checked out\" to follow the actual proofs. The exercises aren't interesting (I'm supposed to fill in tiny details) and the meat of that proof makes me want to sleep. I'm not sure why it \"feels\" so different from the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C04_Sets_and_Functions.html#the-schroder-bernstein-theorem\">Schröder-Bernstein Theorem</a> exercise which I enjoyed quite a lot more.</p>\n<p>I have now started <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C07_Hierarchies.html\">Chapter 7</a> but I'm again falling asleep in the first paragraphs. I think partially it's because the style of the book has changed (there was a fast theory/practice loop in the earlier chapters; this one takes more time to build things up before giving some practice). It's also gotten more abstract (I thought I would enjoy that but I'm not sure now). And the constant use of subscripts is throwing me off and feels annoying.</p>\n<p>Okay, let's be honest, I think I hate these chapters. I'll probably have to pivot to some other material on these topics before I start hating Lean itself.</p>\n<p>I'm lowkey wondering whether it's time to jump off MIL. It may be possible that subsequent chapters are just too much of a slog to get through if I don't already know the relevant mathematics. I suspect that to be motivated, I need to not only have some idea of, but also <em>enjoy</em> the mathematics involved, and this text doesn't convey much enjoyment for me to pick up by osmosis. I'm not sure what to do next though.

I actually have some opinions regarding the learning materials that I mentioned in a DM to an acquaintance; perhaps I should have discussed them publicly at an earlier opportunity, but this present conversation isn't so bad either:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey I recently tried out both MiL and The Mechanics of Proof (TMoP, <a href=\"https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/\">https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/</a> ), and I recommend working through The Mechanics of Proof, and skimming through (especially the latter half) MiL. In this case, the main object of working through TMoP is to become very familiar with the basic and general tactics that you use (even though TMoP uses weaker variants that you would normally use).</p>\n<p>The main objective you should have in mind when skimming through MiL, especially the latter topical chapters, is to mentally bookmark sections and chapters to go back and refer to thoroughly when you encounter a situation that might need them. So when you encounter, say, where you need to prove that two functions are equal you look back at section 4.2 to see that you should use <code>ext</code> for functional extensionality, and when you want to define your own algebraic structures or have a typeclass inference issue you want to understand better you look at chapters 6 and 7. I'm still regularly referring to MiL to orient myself to the main results and style in the various topics in addition to the Mathlib 4 documentation and <a href=\"http://moogle.ai/\">moogle.ai</a>, when working on undergrad mathematics, so it seems that there's not much value in front-loading going through the topical chapters thoroughly since it's still insufficient.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm not sure infinite sums <em>in particular</em> are the object of my interest (from what I understand, many of them are concrete examples of more general results that don't feel as exciting). But there's something about infinite things in general, and ways of dealing with them, that's exciting to me. I think being able to \"traverse infinities\" is what makes mathematics unique.</p>\n<p>I guess anything that's a little mindbending is a good candidate. It's why I liked Schröder-Bernstein Theorem as an example. It deals with infinite and it's a bit mindbending, but once you get it, you get it. I also found <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/epistemic-logic-temporal-epistemic-logic-and-the-blue-eyed-islander-puzzle-lower-bound/\">this writeup about blue-eyed islanders</a> — I doubt I have the chops to seriously attack this formalization, but just learning about the separation of Syntax and Semantics, and notions of completeness and soundness (and how they relate), was very mindbending. I had a few dreams about the relationship between ⊢ and ⊧. I hope to eventually understand the constructions necessary for the Godel theorems but I suspect this is also way off.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what I enjoy, I think I'd have to get familiar with more basic fundamentals that show everywhere, at the very least anything covered in Tao's Analysis, as well as some basic Group theory. Even if it isn't particularly \"exciting\" on its own (but maybe it is?)</p>\n<p>In the Analysis land, I feel drawn to \"fancy\" functions like learning about the Gamma function.

But since this isn't a math book, most of the focus was on translating an inequality into a tedious formalized form — and unlike the earlier chapter, the reader wasn't meant to fill any essential parts of the proof so it felt very non-participatory. I think this just seems like more evidence that I should get excited about the relevant math first from other sources, then try to look at formalizations of that.</p>",

It does start from scratch so some content feels repetitive but I'm really enjoying the practice so far and feel more fluent than before I started. I've just finished chapters 1 and 2 but I'm really excited about the later chapters.
