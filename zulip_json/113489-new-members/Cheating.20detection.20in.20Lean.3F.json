(no easier way I guess?)</li>\n<li>find a bug in the kernel =&gt; admitted. Congratulations to the evil person.</li>\n<li><strong>More ways???</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think being very clear about this question (ideally, having an exhaustive list) can be very useful and might also be worth a page in the tutorial.
