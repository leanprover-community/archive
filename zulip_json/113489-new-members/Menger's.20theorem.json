In <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/34028\">#34028</a> the author also mentioned they'd like to work on Menger's.<br>\nAs for coding standards, see <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html\">#style</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html\">#naming</a>.</p>",
