I don't want to make unreasonable demands of a community that I'm not even really a part of yet. I know it's a huge amount of effort, and a long and thankless slog, to make something new and cool that works well, and I commend the effort. But, right now, a key document of the community has been released <strong>only</strong> in a niche format that lacks the most basic accessibility features, and that <strong>is</strong> a baffling choice to me. I'm sure I'll love Verso once it's feature-complete, but until then, I would love a parallel version in any format I could actually work with. Markdown, Word, PDF, LaTeX, anything at all.</p>",

I don't use a screenreader, so I can't comment on that. But as a simple illustration of how I usually navigate documents on a computer: have you tried increasing the font size? When I do this, the (non-resizable) left-hand menu takes up half of the screen, the lines of code don't wrap, the huge tooltips take over the whole screen, and most importantly, they regularly run <strong>off</strong> the screen (sometimes up, sometimes down), and sometimes don't have the necessary horizontal / vertical scrollbars for me to be able to read them in full. If I increase or decrease the font size to try to read a tooltip or a line of code, it jumps randomly around the page, so I lose what I was reading and have to search for it again.</p>\n<p>I do see what you're going for here, and I love the idea, but I find myself constantly clicking and dragging and scrolling and zooming just to get through a single paragraph, because they're so densely packed with custom artefacts (all the various wavy and dotted lines and pill icons, which all seem to indicate tooltips of various kinds). I've added a few screenshots. I can't speak to everyone's needs: what I can say is that people are typically very good at adapting documents to their own needs if you let them, and this uneditable custom format without any export options prevents that.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Wjgm26GCazucvGLKvvBv8fmC/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/_EBf1krJ5M3ZUzNZgPHVMhIp/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Sg6MJACqAGsf9pMeQ30KSmws/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Gcz1bATKEuyY2vuc87IRyM9h/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Wjgm26GCazucvGLKvvBv8fmC/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1033x596\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/Wjgm26GCazucvGLKvvBv8fmC/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/_EBf1krJ5M3ZUzNZgPHVMhIp/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1016x617\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/_EBf1krJ5M3ZUzNZgPHVMhIp/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Sg6MJACqAGsf9pMeQ30KSmws/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1032x619\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/Sg6MJACqAGsf9pMeQ30KSmws/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/Gcz1bATKEuyY2vuc87IRyM9h/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1034x600\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/Gcz1bATKEuyY2vuc87IRyM9h/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",

As I see it, the following would take care of the biggest problems you're describing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make it easier to get the table of contents out of the way, either by adjusting the width threshold at which it is hidden or by adding a toggle.</li>\n<li>Make it possible to disable the tooltips or make them less likely to accidentally trigger (e.g. via requiring a click).</li>\n<li>Ensure that the tooltips never exceed the size of the viewport.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's not the solution you're asking for, but would it help?</p>\n<p>As far as generating other output formats, that's certainly something on the todo list, but it's not planned in the next few months.</p>\n<p>In the very short term, it might be useful for you to zoom in a bit further, which triggers the alternative layout where the table of contents is hidden.

On your suggestions: number 1 sounds helpful, and I'm sure 2 would be helpful to some people too. 3 is really the key thing for me: I don't want the tooltips disabled, because they clearly contain a huge amount of important information, so I just want them somewhere I can read them. My ideal situation is that they occur in the text itself (in a box or something), but ensuring that they don't exceed the size of the viewport, that they choose a sensible direction to appear (e.g. not opening downwards when my mouse is over a link at the bottom of the page, or upwards at the top), and that they have scrollbars when necessary would be a huge improvement, thanks.</p>\n<p>One other suggestion, which may or may not be easy to implement: can there be a way of expanding the whole document and viewing it all on one page, rather than having to click through sections on the menu? That's not perfect either (it might mean I have to forego the tooltips), but I could then copy and paste the document into Word and print it from there.</p>",

In fact, I have tried all of the above on both Windows 10 and Debian 12, over and over, in various different orders and configurations. I find it hard to believe that there's anything wrong with my toolchain - I've barely <strong>done</strong> anything since I first installed Lean a couple of months ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Please</strong> make this just a <strong>little</strong> bit easier. I am not new to programming, but I'm not a professional software engineer, and I can't spend weeks debugging these things. I just want to prove some theorems.

Portability of the code that produces the output has not been a priority thus far, though it sounds like this should perhaps change.</p>\n<p>If you run it under WSL, then the <code>which</code> command will likely be available and get this step un-stuck. I also get that this isn't so satisfying. I'm out for the next two weeks, but I can look into making the build Windows-friendly when I get back.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the print stylesheet fixes, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"421885\">@Joscha Mennicken</span> - they're greatly appreciated!</p>",
