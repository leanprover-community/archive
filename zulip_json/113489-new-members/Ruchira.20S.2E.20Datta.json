I also worked through a little bit of Software Foundations in Rocq and in Idris 2.  </p>\n<p>My math research interests include graph theory, game theory, combinatorics, algebraic geometry (e.g., real, tropical), and nonlinear optimization. </p>\n<p>My programming language experience includes C, C++, Python, Scala, Java, and Rust (professionally); Ocaml in some of my math research; as well as the languages of some computer algebra systems such as Singular and Mathematica (and various other languages out of personal interest). </p>\n<p>I worked through Laurence Paulson's book _ML for the Working Programmer_. </p>\n<p>I have some interest in description logics, linear temporal logic, model checking, binary decision diagrams, abstract interpretation, etc., though I haven't done work with these yet.</p>\n<p>I've created stochastic simulations and am interested in uncertainty quantification. </p>\n<p>I have extensive professional experience in AI/ML, mostly for NLP..</p>\n<p>Looking forward to participating in and hopefully contributing to the Lean community!</p>",
