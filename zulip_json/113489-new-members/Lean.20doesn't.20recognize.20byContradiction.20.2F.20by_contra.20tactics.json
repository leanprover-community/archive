Now I wanted to prove something by contradiction so I started with <code>open Classical</code>, then I started the proof and everything worked until the moment  I started the proof by contradiction part - I got error message <code>unknown tactic</code> -  both for <code>byContradiction</code> and <code>by_contra</code> (what's the difference between the two by the way?).<br>\nI suspect that maybe I should import something, maybe mathlib? This is the first time I open a lean file by my self - until now I used the files of the Math in Lean textbook, so I'm not sure exactly how to import libraries like mathlib and weather that's even relevant in this case because I didn't get any error on line <code>open Classical</code> so I assume this doesn't require mathlib, right?</p>",
