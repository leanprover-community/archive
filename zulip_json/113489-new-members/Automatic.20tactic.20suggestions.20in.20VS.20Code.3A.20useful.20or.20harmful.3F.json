If I press the <code>tab</code> key, it fills in the proof steps for me. I was wondering: is this feature meant to be used regularly, or is it more like a learning aid? Do you think relying on it is harmful for actually learning how to write proofs in Lean? Also, where exactly can I enable or disable this feature in the VS Code settings?</p>",
