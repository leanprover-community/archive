On the one hand, I really like learning how lean works and more generally I enjoyed learning about Type theory and the alternative foundational ideas it offers and I also want to have some decent level of skill at writing Lean code, but on the other hand I also have a goal of being productive and contributing to Mathlib, and in this process I sometimes don't want to spent too much time on technicalities. I love having automation tools, even just basic tactics like <code>ring</code>, <code>simp</code>, <code>norm_num</code>, <code>linarith</code>,  <code>try?</code>, <code>apply?</code>, <code>exact?</code>, and I thought AI tools for small parts of proof could perhaps act as a more powerful automation tool. But I just recently started using AI, so I guess my opinion on the matter might change over time. Btw, I'm curious how much do you use AI, especially with your ambitious project of formalizing Fermat's Last theorem?</p>",
