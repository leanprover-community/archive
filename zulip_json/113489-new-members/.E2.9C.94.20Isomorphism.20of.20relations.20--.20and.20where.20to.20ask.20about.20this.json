Based on what I understand, this theorem as stated is not universe polymorphic. In particular, it uses <code>Type</code> rather than <code>Type u</code>. However, by simply replacing <code>Type</code> with <code>Type u</code> in the statement and proof, the theorem would become universe polymorphic.</p>\n<p>Being a new user, I have two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is the theorem secretly universe polymorphic, and I am just not seeing it?</li>\n<li>Where is the right place to ask about this? Because I think the new members chat is probably not the right place...</li>\n</ol>",
