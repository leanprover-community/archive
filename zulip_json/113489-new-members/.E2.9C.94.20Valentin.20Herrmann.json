I also attend a lecture (at the LMU) about Minlog, a interactive first oder logic proof system using minimal logic (<a href=\"https://www.ed.math.lmu.de/m/~logik/minlog/\">https://www.ed.math.lmu.de/m/~logik/minlog/</a>).</p>\n<p>I enjoy Lean very much since in my experience it's very well made and documented. Also Lean fits very well in my usual development environment (Emacs + Nix flakes + LSP).</p>\n<p>I'm joining the community because I've met <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"395550\">@Henrik BÃ¶ving</span> this weekend at the Munihac.</p>",
