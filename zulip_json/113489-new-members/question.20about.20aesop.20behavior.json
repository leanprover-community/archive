So I guess this means that aesop did not find the proof, but my command still didn't throw any errors (only warnings). Is this an intended behavior? Is there a way to count this as an error?</p>\n<p>Here is the example I am using (I'm not sure how to convert it to a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html\">#mwe</a> without Mathlib): <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/CLpAmdB7\">https://pastebin.com/CLpAmdB7</a></p>",
