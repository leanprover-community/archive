In those languages I can easy embed that into a string: <code>\"ESC code: \\x1b\"</code>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless the closest I can get in lean is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"bp\">#</span><span class=\"n\">eval</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">s!</span><span class=\"s2\">\"ESC code: {Char.ofNat 0x1B}\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">-- ESC code: \\x1b</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Which is super verbose if I want to use several codes in the same string. Is there any shortcut for this? I'm not able to find information about this in the Lean Manual.</p>",
