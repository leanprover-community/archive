I tried that making a small change to a comment, and it would not build after doing a pull request to mathlib4. The normal way of making a branch worked immediately. So I would delete this: \"Otherwise, you'll need to go to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4</a> and click \"Fork\" in the top right, to make your own fork of the repository.\" I can see how someone waiting for permission to branch might want to create a fork in the interim but not to do a pull request except from a branch.</p>",
