Is there any Lean4 book/online material that could guide me toward this, or is my best bet to pick up a Real Analysis textbook and solve problems in that using lean?</p>",

I was expecting to learn them both simultaneously, similar to the Natural Number Game.  But judging by your next message,  seems like it isn't ideal to learn it from mathlib itself. The thing is, I prefer this style of writing proofs quite a bit more than the traditional style, and so I'm looking for any material that develops real numbers in the same way natural numbers were developed through NNG.</p>",
