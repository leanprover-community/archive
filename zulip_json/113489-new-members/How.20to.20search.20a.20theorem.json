I looked through the <code>Localization</code> and <code>IsLocalization</code> namespaces quickly but didn't find a match yet. Is there a trick, or some general guidance, for such kind of theorem searches? Or even is there a <code>theorem searcher</code> so that I can input my hypothesis types, and it returns the matches? I guess that <code>exact?</code> is the thing I needed, but are there anything else?</li>\n</ol>",
