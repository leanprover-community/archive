I had a project in lean and it made me love the language and the community arround it.</p>\n<p>I am curious about how the Undergrad math in mathlib and Undergrad math not in mathlib pages work: on both pages it says \"To update this list, please submit a PR modifying docs/undergrad.yaml in the mathlib repository.\" and when clicking on it both pages go to the same github file.<br>\nMy confusion comes from the fact that it feels like the two webpages should redirect to two separate lists, or there is something I don't understand?</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nThomas</p>",
