I've just started studying formalization and Lean4, and I have two quick questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the advantages of Lean4 over Lean3?</li>\n<li>From what I understand, when formalizing math began, many people used Lean3, so thousands of math theorems were written in Lean3. After Lean4 was developed, I heard that the project to convert these math libs into Lean4 was completed last year. How did the community manage this conversion? Is there an auto-translator from Lean3 to Lean4?</li>\n</ol>",

Is the partial converter available for public use? I'm curious about how the converter handles the grammar of Lean3 and Lean4.</p>",
