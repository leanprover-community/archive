        "content": "<p>Hallo Lean users! I am Pieter Collins, a researcher at the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. My main research interests are rigorous numerical methods for dynamic systems verification, and computable and constructive analysis. I am a main developer of the Ariadne tool for model-checking nonlinear and hybrid systems in C++. I am interested in using proof assistants to ensure correctness of the theory and implementation of model-checking tools (as there's not much use in having a verification tool with a bug). I have quite a bit of experience with Rocq, and am exploring Lean to see which of the frameworks best fits my needs. </p>\n<p>If I end up working in Lean, I would be interested in contributing to Mathlib, notably in constructive analysis and (rigorous) numerics.</p>",
