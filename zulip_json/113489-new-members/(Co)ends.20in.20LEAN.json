I have just returned from a successful LftCM23 conference (thanks to all organizers and tutors!), where I worked on formalising (co)ends with  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"646478\">@Silvia Properzi</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110789\">@Jakob von Raumer</span>. Now we would like to take this project to completion! An initial goal is to define the equivalence between terminal wedges and limits over the twisted arrow category, and then formalise the results in Chapter 1-2 of Coend Calculus. It would also be nice to formalise weighted (co)limits while we're at it.</p>\n<p>The project is hosted here: <a href=\"https://github.com/malthefogsporring/lean-coends\">https://github.com/malthefogsporring/lean-coends</a>, and anyone is welcome to contribute.</p>\n<p>If anyone is already working on this, please let us know! In particular, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"432631\">@fosco</span> are you still working on this?</p>",
