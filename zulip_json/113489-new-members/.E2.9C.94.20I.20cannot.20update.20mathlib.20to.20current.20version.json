However, in my version of Mathlib, it doesn't exist. I looked for it in the </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>.lake/packages/mathlib\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>folder and it was not there, so I figured that I had an old version of Mathlib. I therefore tried to update it from the command line using </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>curl<span class=\"w\"> </span>-L<span class=\"w\"> </span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/master/lean-toolchain<span class=\"w\"> </span>-o<span class=\"w\"> </span>lean-toolchain\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>lake<span class=\"w\"> </span>update\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>That apparently did not change anything.<br>\nDoes someone know what I did wrong?</p>",
