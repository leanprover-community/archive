a lean4 code file, and you may paste it to local VSCode or lean4 web or somewhere. It complies under this month's mathlib with lean toolchain v4.22.0-rc2, I guess it also works for earlier version. </p>\n<p>I'd like to add the result to Mathlib, seems like we do not have Hilbert basis theorem for power series ring? The proof I post is more than 1000 lines, and I'll try to refine the codes before making pull request to mathlib. </p>\n<p>Anyway, I want to add some lemmas to PowerSeries.Order and PowerSeries.Trunc file first. I have not contributed to Mathlib before, and do not know how to do it. Make the codes obey naming conventions of Mathlib, make a pull request, and start a topic here?</p>",
