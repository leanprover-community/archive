The task is to demonstrate whether a matrix of arbitrary size can be reshaped into another matrix of a different arbitrary size, considering constraints like dimensions and strides. <br>\nMatrix mergeability in this context is the ability to combine multiple dimensions of a matrix into a single dimension while maintaining the integrity of the matrix's structure. It's a key concept for reshaping matrices, where you might merge several rows and columns into a single row or column. The challenge lies in ensuring that this merging process adheres to the matrix's original data arrangement and stride constraints.</p>",
