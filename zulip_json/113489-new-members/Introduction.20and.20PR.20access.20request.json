I am interested in formalizing some foundational representation theory in Lean, with a long-term eye toward geometric Langlands. My short term goal is to formalize contents of the Quantum Hikita Conjecture.</p>\n<p>As a starting point, I've written a coordinate-free construction of the Weyl algebra (affine $\\mathcal{D}$-modules) over a commutative ring using TensorAlgebra and RingQuot.</p>\n<p>I would love to start contributing this to mathlib. Could I please get push access to non-master branches? My GitHub username is Kekedile.</p>",
