Currently a master's student at Louisiana State University (I did my undergrad there as well), with hopes of doing a Ph.D. somewhere colder :) <br>\nMy research interests broadly revolve around representation theory, especially with connections to/intersections with algebraic geometry and number theory. I used to do stuff more on the mathematical physics side of things (supermathematics, specifically), while my current project is in geometric representation theory (studying sort-of \"degenerated\" Schubert varieties)<br>\nI think computer formalization is integral to the future of mathematics, so I want to try and learn and contribute!</p>",
