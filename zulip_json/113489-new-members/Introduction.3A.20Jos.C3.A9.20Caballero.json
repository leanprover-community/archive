        "content": "<p>Hello—I'm <strong>José Caballero</strong>, a PhD candidate at <a href=\"https://www.ulaval.ca/\">Université Laval</a> working at the intersection of algebraic number theory, high-precision numeric calculations and formal verification. I combine high‑precision <a href=\"https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/\">PARI/GP</a> computations with <strong>Lean</strong> proofs to tackle the <a href=\"https://dummit.cos.northeastern.edu/docs/talk_NTS_Starks_conjecture.pdf\">Stark conjectures</a> and certify properties of Stark units, e.g., the growth of the coefficients of their minimal polynomials. After publishing formal work in Isabelle/HOL, succeeding a course about functional programming in Coq and a course on natural language processing, I'm now exploring AI‑assisted proof generation to accelerate verification. If you’re interested in algebraic number theory and/or AI‑driven formal methods, let’s connect! My Archive of Formal Proofs contributions are listed <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/authors/caballero/\">here</a> (my Estonian email is no longer in use). My website is <a href=\"https://josephcmac.github.io/\">here</a>.</p>",
