I could get the <code>\\n</code> to stay by typing <code>\\\\n</code>, but is there a better workaround? Ideally I would disable this specific keybinding in favor of just using <code>\\not</code> for negation.</p>\n<p>I also tried disabling <code>Lean 4 &gt; Input: Eager Replacement Enabled'</code> in settings per <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/blob/master/vscode-lean4/manual/manual.md#unicode-input\">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/blob/master/vscode-lean4/manual/manual.md#unicode-input</a>, but it doesn't seem to work as space and left/right still create the Unicode.</p>",
