We can then give you guidance on what in that direction is feasible and might help you understand mathlib more. Most people have learned first mathematics and then started formalizing what they knew for some time (that usually involves learning more mathematics, because formalization usually goes a different path than most math textbooks).</p>",

Excluding the math courses for computer science (discrete math etc), the math major courses I have taken are abstract algebra and advanced linear algebra, but I plan to self-study more (maybe starting from basic real analysis?). So if it is suggested to formalize what I have learned, I guess I may only be able to work in these areas currently.</p>",
