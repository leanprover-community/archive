I'm doing research in complexity theory and came across Lean and find it to be an amazing project. I want to try to define some simple complexity classes (P, NP, etc..) and write some simple proofs for them as a project for a class. I've been looking through the library and haven't found them already defined but I'm still learning how to navigate and read everything. If I'm missing them please let me know and I'll try to find some way of contributing.</p>",
