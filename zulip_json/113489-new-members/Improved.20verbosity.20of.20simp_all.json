The problem with this is that I don't like magic and would love if there is a way to make <code>simp_all</code> expand on the simplifications that were applied. Does anyone know of a way to turn some of the automation in place here into a more detailed feedback on how the goal was proven? In particular what I am after is a way to have <code>simp_all</code> not simply reach a goal but explain the steps in reaching it, even if it means \"unfolding\" its work into more verbose set of Lean 4 statements.</p>",
