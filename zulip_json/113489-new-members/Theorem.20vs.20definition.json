If I understand correctly, <code>theorem th1 : P := x</code> should be read as \"expression <code>th1</code> defined by<code>th1 := x</code> has type <code>P</code>, where <code>P : Prop</code>\", and proving a theorem that <code>P</code> is true amounts to constructing any expression of type <code>P</code> (equivalently, there exists <code>_ : P</code> or <code>P</code> is non-empty). So the only thing that matters is that types check out, right?</p>\n<p>Does it mean that <code>def</code> is technically the same as <code>theorem</code> and the main difference is that it admits expressions of types other than <code>P : Prop</code>?</p>",
