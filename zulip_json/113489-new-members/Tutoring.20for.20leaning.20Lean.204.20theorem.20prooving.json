I'm starting to get the hang of using it as a functional programming language but the tactics proving language is still impenetrable to me despite my attempts to read the various educational resources on my own. I have a hundred noob questions that I'm sure could be answered over the course of a few sessions of one-on-one interaction with an experienced Lean proof writer. </p>\n<p>Time zone wise, I live in Toronto (Eastern Standard Time). </p>\n<p>If you are available, please DM me and let me know what you charge for an hour of private tutoring. </p>\n<p>I have a couple of weeks off work over the holidays so it would great to get a couple of initial sessions in then as I'll have more time to practice.</p>",
