A couple questions:</p>\n<p>1) Each time a project is created, there is a lengthy download. Is that the way it is supposed to be?</p>\n<p>2) Is there a way to run Lean code from the command line? Something like a \"Hello, World\"? I find it difficult to see what is wrong from Visual Code, so a command line example would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
