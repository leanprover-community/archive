        "content": "<p>Hi all, as an effort to learn another proof assistant rather than just EasyCrypt, I want to try out a little project in Lean. I have this result that applies theory of computation to cryptography:</p>\n<p>A reduction from cryptographic primitive X to Y means that if X is secure, then Y is secure. In cryptography, we normally use Turing reductions, which means that we can take the X to Y reduction and say that if X is secure relative to oracle O, then so is Y. We then say that X reduces to Y, relative to O. I would like to prove that fully black box reductions allow us to relativise reductions as I just described.</p>\n<p>As an example of what I would need from Lean, I'll just quickly recap what a cryptographic primitive is according to <a href=\"https://lucatrevisan.github.io/pubs/rtv04.pdf\">https://lucatrevisan.github.io/pubs/rtv04.pdf</a>, which is the starting point for the pen-and-paper proof.</p>\n<p>A primitive is a tuple F and R, whereby F = set of all functions  (aka implementations) f_i : A_i -&gt; B_i that conform to some behaviour (e.g., hash will compress your input), and R is a list of all Turing machines M and implementations f \\in F such that M breaks f per some definition (e.g., finding a collision is difficult). An implementation g is secure if all Turing machines M  &lt; g, M&gt; \\in R are <strong>not</strong> probabilistic polynomial time. We say that g is efficient if it is computable by a probabilistic polynomial time turing machine.</p>\n<p>Just there, we already need to define Turing machines, infinite list of functions, define interaction between Turing machines, complexity classes, a computational model, what a reduction is etc...</p>\n<p>Can anyone help me understand if Lean is a good candidate for this kind of task? I really appreciate it!</p>",
