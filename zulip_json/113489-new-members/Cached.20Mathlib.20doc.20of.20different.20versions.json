Since the existing searching applications like leandojo's retriever and leansearch all rely on a specific version of Mathlib, I think at least we need to know which one is stable and safe to use, and which one needs an update. </p>\n<p>By the way, leandojo's retriever seems never update since its release. That means it still uses 4.2.0-rc1. I suspect its validity now. Looking forward to a tool analyzing and visualizing the differences between any two versions of Mathlib. The community page only displays the current status and progress by year, which is not so helpful. If there hasn't been such a tool, maybe I will have a try to build one at my free time.</p>",

Despite those who are working on the expansion of Mathlib, there are still people who need a stable version. Maybe for teaching or machine learning.</p>",
