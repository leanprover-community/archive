        "content": "<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>As we all know, having Lean 4 provide responsive feedback in the infoview is crucial for a smooth proving workflow. Similarly, when using tactics like <code>rw?</code>, <code>apply?</code>, or <code>simp?</code>, we ideally want quick suggestions (though realistically, this can often take several seconds or more). When the system feels sluggish, it can be quite frustrating and impact productivity. I often find myself wishing for a faster setup.</p>\n<p>This leads me to my main question: What is currently considered a good or even optimal computer configuration for working effectively with Lean 4?</p>\n<p>I'm curious about recommendations for both desktops and laptops. For instance, while desktops often have superior GPU performance for gaming, my understanding is that Lean primarily relies on the CPU. Is that correct?</p>\n<p>Specifically, what kind of specs should one look for regarding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CPU:</strong> (Clock speed? Core count?)</li>\n<li><strong>RAM:</strong> (How much is recommended for a smooth experience, especially with large projects like Mathlib? 16GB? 32GB? More?)</li>\n<li><strong>Storage:</strong> (Is a fast SSD, like NVMe, significantly beneficial? What capacity is comfortable?)</li>\n<li><strong>GPU:</strong> (Is it largely irrelevant for Lean performance?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, does Lean 4's performance or the overall development experience differ noticeably between operating systems, such as macOS versus Windows (perhaps using WSL)?</p>\n<p>Essentially, if one wanted to configure a system (within a reasonable budget for a standard PC/laptop) to minimize waiting times and maximize responsiveness when writing Lean code, what would you advise?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any insights or recommendations!</p>",

Assuming I must use the Windows operating system for general-purpose use, I'd like to know which CPU offers better performance: the U9-285K or the R9-9950X? It's said that the U9 has stronger single-core performance, so I'm wondering if it would compile a single Lean file faster than the R9?</p>\n<p>Also, how does the speed of an R9-9950X on a Windows host running Linux via WSL compare to a Mac laptop with an M4 Max chip? (This is also important! Because we can always expect good things from Mac CPUs.)</p>",
