        "content": "<p>Hello, I am new so excuse the lack of knowledge. I have followed the instructions provided <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html\">here</a> to create a project. I have followed the instructions exactly as they are written, and multiple attempts. Essentially when I have a lean file, is says \"Waiting for Lean server to start...\" in the infoview and there is a \"Starting Lean language client\" popup, as in the screenshot. The progress bar always gets to the same point and stops. If I wait for around 30-40 minutes, it eventually works correctly, without any issues. I'm just wondering why it is taking so long? Help would be appreciated, thanks.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/ImQZPoWLCDeWSw35ep2XBIWa/Screenshot-2023-11-02-194111.png\">Screenshot-2023-11-02-194111.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/ImQZPoWLCDeWSw35ep2XBIWa/Screenshot-2023-11-02-194111.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2023-11-02-194111.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/ImQZPoWLCDeWSw35ep2XBIWa/Screenshot-2023-11-02-194111.png\"></a></div>",
