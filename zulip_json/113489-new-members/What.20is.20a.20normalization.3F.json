My question is: what is a normalization? They gave example \"every expression of type Nat is a numeral\", which I understand, but this is an example, not a definition. What is a normal form of an expression of more general inductive or functional type? And, morally, why propositional extensionality somehow \"blocks\" it?</p>",
