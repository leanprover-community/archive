The actual sequence involved a bunch of no doubt superfluous steps.</p>\n<p>What I actually did was:</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n<li>(I had homebrew and <code>git</code> already installed in both intel and arm64 versions, though I didn't realize I had both copies at first).</li>\n<li>\n<p>I ran the install command from [https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html] in Terminal:<br>\n<code>/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/install_macos.sh)\" &amp;&amp; source ~/.profile</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I followed these instructions [https://osxdaily.com/2020/11/18/how-run-homebrew-x86-terminal-apple-silicon-mac/] to make a duplicate Terminal that would run using Rosetta.</p>\n</li>\n<li>I basically now reran a bunch of installers both terminals. Homebrew; the install command from Step 1; Bryan's suggested package for <code>elan</code>; VSCode; <code>brew install gmp</code> and <code>brew install coreutils</code>. (Some of these installers automatically declined to make a second copy of their installation.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point I was able to copy the tutorial using <code>leanproject get tutorials</code>. When I opened it in VSCode, it caused a bunch of \"memory capacity exceeded\" errors in the VSCode Infoview (I forget the exact error message, unfortunately). This stopped happening once I ran <code>leanproject build tutorials</code>. I'm not sure if that was supposed to be necessary.</p>\n<p>Still, lean was still not functional because it couldn't detect gmp.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Finally I forced Homebrew to install the x86 gmp using Julian's suggestion. Specifically I went and found the intel Homebrew installed in <code>/usr/local/Homebrew</code> and ran the gmp installer with it as <code>/usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew install gmp</code> instead of <code>brew install gmp</code>. (The latter command had been, I think, invoking <code>arm64</code> Homebrew even if I ran it in the Rosetta Terminal.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That seemed to do it!</p>\n<p>(edit: Oh, there was more too. I think I ran some other commands like <code>pipx ensurepath</code> and maybe related stuff in both terminals. Basically I was trying to do all the steps from <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html</a>.)</p>\n<p>If I have time this weekend I'll delete it all and try a fresh install.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hello. I'm a complete noob. I downloaded and installed Lean using the instructions available at<br>\n<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html</a><br>\nIn particular, I installed GitBashPython and VS Code following the instructions. After that, I downloaded the tutorial project following the instructions available at<br>\n<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html</a><br>\nI'm currently going through the tutorial project, and I haven't had too much mathematical trouble yet. I wanted to create a project of my own so that I could write Lean code just by myself and experiment (using some of the code snippets and exercises in Theorem Proving in Lean, which I'm reading). I tried to do that using the instructions available on the aforementioned web page. In particular, I ran the command<br>\nleanproject new proj1<br>\ninside Git Bash (which I had also downloaded when installing Lean). There was some output, but it contained an error message. The main error message seems to be \"binary package was not provided for 'windows' \". In detail:</p>\n<p>anwoy@anwoy-laptop MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/Work_tmp/Tmp<br>\n$ leanproject new proj1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>cd proj1<br>\ngit init -q<br>\ngit checkout -b lean-3.42.1<br>\nSwitched to a new branch 'lean-3.42.1'<br>\nconfiguring proj1 0.1<br>\nAdding mathlib<br>\ninfo: downloading component 'lean'<br>\nerror: binary package was not provided for 'windows'<br>\nCommand '['leanpkg', 'add', 'leanprover-community/mathlib']' returned non-zero exit status 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the folder \"proj1\" was indeed created. I opened that folder in VS Code and tried to create a \".lean\" file. As soon as I did that, though, there was an error message, very similar to the one above. I'm attaching a screenshot for reference.</p>\n<p>The strange thing is that I can work in the \"tutorials\" folder perfectly. None of the files in that folder show any errors, and I can even create \".lean\" files of my own, and they are created error-free (I've done nothing on my own yet). Does anyone know what's going on and how this can be fixed? I would be very grateful for any help. If this is not the appropriate place to post this query, I apologize. I would be grateful if someone could direct me to the correct place.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any and all help! <a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/XcSrOjAL8TUY4QOp-qFEkO39/err_mssg.png\">err_mssg.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/XcSrOjAL8TUY4QOp-qFEkO39/err_mssg.png\" title=\"err_mssg.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/XcSrOjAL8TUY4QOp-qFEkO39/err_mssg.png\"></a></div>",
