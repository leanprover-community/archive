        "content": "<p>Hello, I have a lot of experience with Coq/Rocq but I am brand new to Lean, and I am working through \"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\". In Coq, one typically proceeds tactic-by-tactic and can see the proof state at each step. When I am using Lean in VSCode, the info view is constantly changing as I type, including sometimes disappearing entirely in the middle of writing a tactic. This is very difficult to manage, as I find myself having to move the cursor just to remember hypothesis names and the goal shape. Is there a setting or way to make the display update less frequently, either on command or when a tactic is applied (like in the Natural Number Game)? I know about the pin/pause/unpause button in the VSCode proof view window, but that doesn't seem like a practical thing to do regularly. Thanks!</p>",
