I was checking the mathlib and found some necessary definitions but nothing in the direction to prove the theorem. </p>\n<p>I'm a mathematician working on universal algebra and I took a category theory course, so I'm familiar with the result to formalize it.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there is any work or progress to formalize something about categorical dualities and if you have any suggestions.</p>",
