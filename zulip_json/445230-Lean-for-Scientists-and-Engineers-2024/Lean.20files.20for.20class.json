I did sign up then drop a class in differential equations thinking I would never use it again in programming. That was 40 years ago. However I did take a class in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis\">numerical methods</a> and that was quite useful but I don't remember getting to RK4.  After  many years I needed to learn how to do ODEs for biological simulations and a book noted the use of RK4. It was one of those times in life where I had to mentally erase that fallacy to take a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>On a side note, do you know of a blog entry or page that explains why \"most ODEs cannot be solved symbolically!\" You might be surprised at how popular such a link would be for programmers trying to solve ODEs who still think that they should be solved symbolically.  <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

What are other examples of math problems that can not be solved symbolically starting from a symbolic expression?</p>\n<p><strong>Completion:</strong></p>\n<p>There are several types of mathematical problems that cannot be solved symbolically, meaning they don't have closed-form solutions or exact symbolic representations. Here are some examples:</p>\n<h3>1. <strong>Nonlinear Equations</strong></h3>\n<p>- Many nonlinear equations, especially higher-degree polynomials beyond the fourth degree, cannot be solved symbolically. For example, the general quintic equation (fifth-degree polynomial) cannot be solved using radicals, as established by the Abel-Ruffini theorem.</p>\n<h3>2. <strong>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)</strong></h3>\n<p>- Many PDEs, such as the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, do not have known symbolic solutions in the general case. Solutions often require numerical methods or approximations.</p>\n<h3>3. <strong>Transcendental Equations</strong></h3>\n<p>- Equations involving transcendental functions (like exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, etc.) often do not have closed-form solutions. An example is \\( x = e^{-x} \\), which cannot be solved exactly for \\( x \\) in terms of elementary functions.</p>\n<h3>4. <strong>Optimization Problems</strong></h3>\n<p>- Many optimization problems, especially those involving nonlinear objective functions or constraints, do not have closed-form solutions. Problems such as finding the global minimum of a non-convex function often require numerical methods.</p>\n<h3>5. <strong>Integration Problems</strong></h3>\n<p>- Some integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. A classic example is the integral \\( \\int e^{x^2} dx \\), which does not have a symbolic solution and is usually expressed in terms of the error function \\( \\text{erf}(x) \\).</p>\n<h3>6. <strong>Special Functions</strong></h3>\n<p>- Solutions involving special functions (like the gamma function, Bessel functions, or elliptic integrals) are often not solvable symbolically except in very specific cases. These functions themselves are often defined by integrals or series that cannot be simplified further symbolically.</p>\n<h3>7. <strong>Discrete Dynamical Systems</strong></h3>\n<p>- Some discrete dynamical systems, such as those governed by certain recurrence relations, do not have closed-form solutions. For instance, the general solution to nonlinear recurrence relations often cannot be expressed symbolically.</p>\n<h3>8. <strong>Diophantine Equations</strong></h3>\n<p>- Many Diophantine equations, which seek integer solutions to polynomial equations, do not have general symbolic solutions. For example, there is no general method to solve the equation \\( x^n + y^n = z^n \\) (for \\( n &gt; 2 \\)) in integers, which is related to Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>\n<h3>9. <strong>Systems of Equations</strong></h3>\n<p>- Some systems of equations, particularly nonlinear or higher-dimensional systems, cannot be solved symbolically. This is common in systems arising in areas such as game theory or economic modeling.</p>\n<h3>10. <strong>Fractals and Chaotic Systems</strong></h3>\n<p>- Equations describing fractals or chaotic systems often do not have symbolic solutions, as their behavior is inherently complex and sensitive to initial conditions.</p>\n<p>These examples illustrate the wide range of mathematical problems where symbolic solutions are either impossible or impractical, necessitating the use of numerical methods, approximations, or special functions.</p>",
