Honestly, this should be nonnegotiable for every learning material. ArXiV does all three.</p>\n<p><strong>Further reasoning</strong>: building PDFs, single HTML pages, LaTeX source could all be automated without much drag on the authors. Since it does require some one-time development effort, it can't be expected out of every reader to do it themselves and duplicate the work. Some readers are not even technical enough to do it, even if it's just a few github files to be compiled, but would find these options useful if they were just a click away.</p>",
