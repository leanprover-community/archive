Over the course of this, I developed a test suite that tests each compiler feature <em>in isolation</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/bollu/lean4/tree/1-aug-2022-llvm-backend/tests/backendramp\">https://github.com/bollu/lean4/tree/1-aug-2022-llvm-backend/tests/backendramp</a></p>\n<p>I propose upstreaming this test suite, because it would provide a logical place to test new features to the backend, and help in the development of alternate backends. This test suite would concretely help with the current <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/2090\">LLVM <code>size_t</code> fixes</a>, and might help provide minimal test cases for the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/wasm.20build\">ongoing WASM effort</a>.</p>",
