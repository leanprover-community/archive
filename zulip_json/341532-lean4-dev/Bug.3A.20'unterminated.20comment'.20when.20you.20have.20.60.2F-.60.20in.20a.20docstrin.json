Turns out, I had <code>+/-</code> in a docstring somewhere, as in the following MWE:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"sd\">/-- `x +/- y` -/</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">String</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"foo\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">-- We get `unterminated comment` at the *end* of the file, even if we introduce other definitions after `test`</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>(confirmed on <code>nightly-2024-08-11</code>)</p>\n<p>The workaround is easy, but this seems like a bug. At the very least, the error should be located at the actual comment that it believes to be unterminated, but I think having <code>/-</code> inside a docstring should not be seen as starting a nested comment.</p>\n<p>Also, VSCode highlights the docstring in the MWE as expected, making it appear properly terminated</p>\n<p>EDIT: Cross-posted to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/5005\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/5005</a></p>",
