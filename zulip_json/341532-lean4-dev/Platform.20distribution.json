Anyway, if you are curious about what platforms Lean users use, these are the numbers for nightly 2013-01-16, the current mathlib4 target:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>macOS x64 — Downloaded 34 times</li>\n<li>macOS aarch64 — Downloaded 19 times</li>\n<li>Linux x64 — Downloaded 2,499 times</li>\n<li>Windows x64 — Downloaded 39 times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Linux numbers are obviously heavily skewed by CI use. For subsequent nightlies not used by mathlib4 yet the numbers are more like 6/8/77/22 (2013-01-17), but that might still include a completely unknown amount of other CI.</p>",
