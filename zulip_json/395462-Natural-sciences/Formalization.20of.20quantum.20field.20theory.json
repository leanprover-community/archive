I have also had private communication with multiple other people that have expressed similar concerns. As has been said elsewhere, this part of formalization is extremely important, and is no small task. A number that I have seen is that it contributes to (at least) 50% of the work, and this is a number that I would agree with. </p>\n<p>I’m not completely convinced that the severity of these points have been fully grasped by your group, or adequately reasoned away. Again multiple others in this community have conveyed a similar message to me privately.  This is fine, and you are under no obligation to do so, as you may have different priorities and interests with formalization. However, due to the prevalence of these dissents within this community, hopefully you will agree with me that, if not addressed before publication, it is academically the correct thing to do to make the physics community aware of them in parallel with your formalisation. I feel this is particularly important because, as you are no doubt aware, your voice and the voice of your group carries a particular weight within the physics community. I would appreciate it if you could let me know here if you plan on doing this, or give the reasons for not? If not I am happy to disseminate something to this effect.</p>",

Global internal symmetries ($V \\toL[\\mathbb{K}] W$) - not yet local ones - are lifted to the distribution space via WeakDual.comap.</p>",

I also think everyone cares that the code eventually is polished, where the parts of the code that are immediately of value to others, are prioritized and refactored such that they are a service to the community. However, there is obviously value in letting users have access to the current state of the code for their own projects to use parts that are of value to their current projects. This includes the fact that the code is of course not ready to be integrated to PhysLean or Mathlib in the current state. Moreover, releasing code that is \"merely true\" and sharing the result allows others to time their projects w.r.t. our refactor in a way that is highly aligned with the overall incentives of a collaborative physics community. If your concern pertains primarily to publication, our draft states the limitations of our formalization and states that the code will need a major refactor to meet the important standards upheld in PhysLean and Mathlib. We see this as no small task and really appreciate all those who have extended help in significantly improving our formalization.</p>",
