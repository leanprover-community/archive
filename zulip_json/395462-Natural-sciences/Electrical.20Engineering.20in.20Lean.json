        "content": "<p>Hello, I am wondering if there are any people that do electricity related activities in Lean? I have started a small free-time project attempting to formalize the DC Loadflow equations in Lean (<a href=\"https://github.com/blacksph3re/distribution_factors\">https://github.com/blacksph3re/distribution_factors</a>). For those of you who don't know, the DC Loadflow equations are a linearization of the physics of electricity grids. A big bag of assumptions, but enough to compute something. Hence it's just linear algebra but I am still struggling a bit as I am new to lean, so I am grateful for help or contact to other people who struggle as much as I do :)</p>",

I’ll have a look into it, thanks for making this intro :) so far I’ve been able to solve everything eventually but I think my proofs are the very opposite of neat. I’ll check out the lecture maybe that’ll teach me to write cleaner lean.</p>",
