It would also be great to have more people involved in this project.</p>\n<p>There is some motivation for starting with something like high-energy physics, rather than say more 'basic physics results'.  Parts of high energy physics are very close to mathematics (some are indistinguishable from mathematics), thus it lends itself very nicely to formalisation into Lean. I also believe that the way to get the physics community involved in Lean is to show them how it can be useful in their research. (I note that high energy physics is quite broad, and includes all but 4 of the points you mention).</p>\n<p>It is my opinion that we are not ready for something like PhysicsLib, for the whole of physics. Physics communities are quite separated from one another, and have their own cultures and expectations. It's hard to imagine fitting all of that into one project, and keeping everyone happy/been able to motivate people that its a good idea.</p>",

If you know things that are outdated on this page then it would be great to say it. I am sure there are a couple of outdated items.

This is a notion that is emphasized in a certain style of elementary courses, although it is mathematically “useless”. So it is not developed in Mathlib, but it is a question that arises on Zulip from time to time. One way to try to fix that is to create a Lean file with explanations about how to  get partial derivatives from Fréchet derivatives, so that we can point to it from that undergrad list and when people ask. But it should probably come with big warnings telling people to not build on this. Nobody took the trouble to do it, that’s all.</p>",

We never actually compute actions or path-integrals (because we can't). We work with approximations. </p>\n<p>One approximation is to use Feynman diagrams, which gives you perturbative quantum field theory. The other is to use the variational principle, which gives you classical field theory. </p>\n<p>When a physicist does the variational principle, they literally just stick their Lagrangian into the Euler-Lagrange  equations and see what happens. </p>\n<p>Thus to the physicist, there little point worrying about what functions these integrals are defined on, because we never calculate these integrals. We have a definition of a field theory (a Lagrangian and some fields), and different ways to approximate that field theory. We give half-hearted attempts to justify these approximations, but until we work out the correct definition of the path integral (e.g. through functorial field theory), this is the best we can do.</p>",

Maybe one could \"lift\" a subset of formal problems to well-defined integrals and prove that the formal manipulations always give the correct result.</p>",
