They help clarify the goals and explain the theory when needed.</p>\n<p>• The <em>formal manager</em> is someone comfortable with Lean who can help set up the repository, guide the formalization choices, and coordinate the proof development.</p>\n<p><strong>Expressing interest</strong></p>\n<p>Adding your name under a project means you are potentially interested in working on it during the project sessions. You can express interest in several projects, though as a guideline we suggest not exceeding three or four. In the end we expect each participant to choose one project to focus on.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentations on day 1</strong></p>\n<p>During the project management session on Tuesday, the organizers will select a set of projects to be presented briefly (about two to three minutes each). Selection will depend on having volunteers for both informal and formal roles, and on the level of interest in the project. After these presentations, participants will choose the project they will join.</p>\n<p><strong>Project scope</strong></p>\n<p>A project can be a small standalone task or a well defined part of a larger ongoing project, but it should be something where a small group can reasonably make progress during the allocated project work sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>Final presentations</strong></p>\n<p>On the last day, each active project will be invited to give a short informal update on what was achieved and what the next steps might be. No written report is required.</p>\n<p>Feel free to add proposals and comments here in the thread, but don't forget to update the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/190xZVCZST0tlCDO9Ijzf3Emp2ni0w84xW4DnhYU891Q/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Sheet</a>.

I think that this would be a great beginner project; ideally you would consult with experts on how to <em>state</em> the theorems you want to prove, and then try and prove them yourselves. The step from set theory to type theory is a bit subtle here: in Lean groups and subgroups are different things -- in set theory a subgroup \"is\" a group but in Lean a subgroup can be turned into a group, but a subgroup is a term and a group is a type, which means that sometimes there can be several ways of translating statements from paper mathematics into Lean and you want to do the translation in such a way as to make the proofs as straightforward as possible rather than having to wrestle with foundations.</p>",

I'd be happy to set up a project to work on this. It's beginner-friendly in the sense that you get to learn about parts of Mathlib without wrangling Lean too much, and it should be immediately useful to Mathlib. But of course it's not the typical Mathlib work that people probably want to learn about. For a more ambitious angle, we could also look for opportunities to automate with custom tactics where the standard tactics don't quite do the job. Anyone interested in this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please also feel free to look at CSLib as part of this if you'd like. We make extensive use of <code>grind</code>, but there are some improvements to be made, as we have a fairly long list of exceptions to <code>#grind_lint</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/cslib/blob/7cc148956f366d1ef096d370aeb4e228a08f0bd3/CslibTests/GrindLint.lean\">this test</a>. This could be an opportunity to try out the new constraint feature of <code>grind_pattern</code>. In particular the System F formalization there has a concentration of performance issues currently.</p>",

Would this be considered a meaningful project, or are these lemmas already present in Mathlib in forms I’ve overlooked?</p>",
