I'm currently in the process of reorganizing the early levels so that the constructions involving elements of types come before the corresponding constructions involving proofs of propositions. As a result the comments in the left hand columns that accompany each level need some editing. The first two worlds are fairly polished and the third (Implication World) is in decent (but not perfect) shape. I'll polish these up as quickly as I can and push updates frequently.</p>",
