Installation problems can sometimes take time to solve, and it would be helpful if participants arrive with their environment mostly ready.</p>\n<p>Please remember to <strong>bring your own laptop</strong>, as it will be essential for following the tutorials and for participating in project work sessions.</p>\n<p>There will nonetheless be a <strong>dedicated troubleshooting session</strong> on the first afternoon for installation and GitHub issues, running in parallel with the initial project activities.</p>",
