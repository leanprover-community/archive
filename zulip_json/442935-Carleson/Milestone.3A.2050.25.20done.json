To be honest, after having talked to Hairer about the nature of hard analysis, I was a bit scared that formalizing hard analysis might be a fair bit trickier than formalizing hard commutative algebra and that this project would be a great test to see if this were true. What I was worried about was whether analysis relied more on \"principles\" rather than very general theorems of the kind you find in alg geom, which apply in huge generality. In analysis the impression I got was that it was harder to formalise precise theorems which accurately summarised the complete extent of a technique.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The progress is indeed a lot faster than I expected. Of course, for this I have to thank all the contributors that have participated in the Carleson project so far. I want to especially mention <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"598052\">@Jeremy Tan</span> here, who is going above and beyond to contribute to this project, and is sending near-daily PRs.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the blueprint is indeed very detailed. Many of the principles that are typically used on a high-level are written out carefully in this blueprint, and I need to really thank the harmonic analysis group here in Bonn for that. So far the blueprint is holding up amazingly well. We've found some minor mistakes, some typos, and a few cases where a lemma needed a slightly different proof, but all of the changes were very localized so far.</p>\n<p>The length of the blueprint is probably a bit misleading: the original proof was ~30 pages, but that was expanded to the current page count by adding a lot more details. The proof is so detailed that even with very little experience in analysis, you can locally understand the proof of a lemma and formalize it, without knowing the full proof structure. The work by Jeremy Tan and Leo Diedering has shown this, since they knew very little about harmonic analysis before starting this project.</p>\n<p>Finally, this project has required very few preliminaries. We didn't have to develop a theory of e.g. vector bundles first. There is a bit about doubling measures, and Jim Portegies proved the real interpolation theorem (which the blueprint actually doesn't explicitly depend on by \"inlining\" a proof of the special case - but we can use it in 2 places). And Mathlib is working really really well for this project. The measure theory library works well, and has e.g. (almost) all integral inequalities we need.</p>\n<p>About the reusability: it might be true that a lot of the material is not super useful for Mathlib, and the current code quality is not (yet) Mathlib code quality. But there are definitely a bunch of reusable preliminaries that we will put into Mathlib. And we've learned design decisions.
