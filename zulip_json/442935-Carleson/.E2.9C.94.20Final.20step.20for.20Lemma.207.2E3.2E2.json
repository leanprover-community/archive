Then L \\cap<br>\nE(q) is still contained in E_2(n, p''), with possibly a constant n a<br>\nlittle bit larger than 6. This follows from similar arguments as in the<br>\nother case, using that now B_u(Q(u),1) is contained in B_p'(Q(p'), 4)<br>\ninstead of that \\Omega(u) and \\Omega(p') intersect.<br>\nI will change this in the blueprint later.</p>\n</blockquote>",
