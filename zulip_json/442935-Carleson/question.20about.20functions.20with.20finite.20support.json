Mathematically, if we want to avoid <code>BoundedFiniteSupport</code>, I expect we have to strengthen Theorems 1.0.2 and 10.0.1 so that they say \"compact support\" instead of \"finite support\".

I can see an argument for both; there are lots of possible slight variants of this function class. Anyways, I don't think this is an important discussion and I don't care which one is used.
