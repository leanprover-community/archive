The new chapter 10 proves Carleson's theorem for two-sided Calderon-Zygmund kernels on metric spaces. This generalizes the Cotlar inequality and Calderon-Zygmund-decomposition that before were stated specifically for the real line, and they are now stated for metric spaces. The new chapter 11 contains the remaining part of the argument reducing Carleson's theorem to the real line. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"657719\">@Terence Tao</span> also suggested to us to do this generalization.<br>\nThis was part of Leo's bachelor thesis(!), the other part was formalizing many of the results that are now in chapter 11.</p>",

And could you make sure that <code>classical-Carleson</code> is the unique minimal element in the dependency graph? (<code>two-sided-metric-space-Carleson</code> likely needs a bunch more entries in its <code>uses{}</code> command).</p>",
