        "content": "<p>Just a heads up about an extra assumption in the Real Interpolation Theorem: Part of what one needs to prove is that the map T preserves strong measurability on L^p, where L^p is the interpolated space. However, I think this is something one cannot prove but needs to assume, because a quasilinear map seems to give a lot of flexibility to artificially bring in some non-measurability. In the references that I find, the assumption is usually that T preserves measurability on L^p0 + L^p1, but currently I'm leaning towards just assuming the preservation of measurability on L^p directly; I think that may be enough.</p>",

From that you should be able to conclude that it preserves measurability on <code>L^p</code>, right? It would be very nice if we don't need to add an additional assumption.</p>",
