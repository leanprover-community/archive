I think I might be able to handle this, but I just want to understand:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do we even need this theorem?</li>\n<li>What's the difference between <code>G : Type</code> and <code>G : Type*</code>? I thought that <code>Type</code> introduced a (single) fresh variable and <code>Type*</code> just did it for each variable in the telescope. Are these two things equivalent already?</li>\n</ol>",

Of course the Lowenheim-Skolem (together with this simpler counterpart) tells us that we never actually <em>need</em> to use models this large, but one could imagine that it is sometimes convenient.  (In model theory it is sometimes convenient to work with extremely saturated models constructed using large cardinals in order to get some nice symmetry and completeness properties.  I <em>doubt</em> we will ever need this level of sophistication for our current project, but it is theoretically possible.)</p>",
