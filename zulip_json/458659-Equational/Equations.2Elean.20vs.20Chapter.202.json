I had an error in CI in <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/460\">equational#460</a> because equation 953 is used in <code>Subgraph.lean</code> and is refered to in Chapter 2, but was not in <code>Equations.lean</code> (it was transitively being imported through the backdoor, accidentally I presume). There are more though, like 477, that's also in Chapter 2 but not in Equations.lean. Should these two agree? Should we add the missing ones from the blueprint to the file, or vice-versa?</p>",
