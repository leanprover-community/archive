        "content": "<p>One of the outcomes of this project is that we have started to assemble a nice suite of techniques to analyze any given equation, <code>EquationX</code>(and the laws implied by this equation), and I thought I might try to create a thread to collect them here as the project continues.  Here are some to get started:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Test <code>EquationX</code> against linear magmas <code>x ◇ y = ax+by</code> in various fields, commutative rings, and/or non-commutative rings, and study the resulting constraints on <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</li>\n<li>Test <code>EquationX</code> against translation invariant magmas <code>x ◇ y = x + f(y-x)</code> on an additive group <code>G</code>, and study the resulting functional equation on <code>f</code>.  Non-abelian constructions are also possible.</li>\n<li>Use SAT solvers (either fully automated, or human-guided) to generate medium-sized finite models for <code>EquationX</code>, which can hopefully be used to rule out many implications to other equations. One can also use brute force to exhaust all small finite models (size 4 or less). Random linear or quadratic models on cyclic groups have proven somewhat effective in practice.</li>\n<li>Observe \"invariants\" of the left and right hand sides of <code>EquationX</code>.  If they match, then any equation implied by <code>EquationX</code> must also have matching invariants. (One way to generate such invariants is by abstract nonsense, mapping both sides of the equation to elements of a free magma modulo some reference theory.)</li>\n<li>Use an automated greedy algorithm (invoking SAT solvers if needed) to hopefully find a complete ruleset for greedy extension for <code>EquationX</code>; if they exist, this tends to settle all outstanding implications in practice.</li>\n<li>Try to see if <code>EquationX</code> is confluent (do we have a concrete procedure for this?), which gives a tractable description of the free magma subject to this law, and thus allows one to resolve <em>all</em> implications of this law.</li>\n<li>If confluence fails, a complete rewriting system for <code>EquationX</code> is still possible (how can one guess this is the case, and what should one do to find it?).</li>\n<li>Start with some simple \"base model\" of <code>EquationX</code>, such as a translation-invariant model, and try to construct local modifications of it to disprove possible consequences of that law.</li>\n<li>Use standard automated theorem provers to see if <code>EquationX</code> implies, or does not imply, another given law.</li>\n<li>We have <a href=\"#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1648.20!.3D.3E.20206/near/476987749\">one isolated example</a> of a graph-theoretic construction (based on an infinite regular tree).  Possibly there are ways to generalize this type of construction more systematically to other equations? [EDIT: See <a href=\"#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/1648.20!.3D.3E.20206/near/477378333\">this second example</a>.]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any corrections, additions, or clarifications would be welcome.</p>",

Perhaps there's a way for the algorithms to provide lazy evaluations (1) or imperfect (but not useless) insights?  </li>\n<li>Point 1 and 2 could be seen as some sort of algebraic modeling / constraint derivation, 3 and 5 as computational model generation / analysis. Invariant identification and property analysis seem like very powerful tools that could be done in a greedy way. 6 and 7 - confluence + rewriting. </li>\n<li>The approach could  be viewed as a universe (that is modeled by EquationX in specific structures) an agent \"enters\". That agent would then generate and analyze its own model of that structure (while exploring it; that includes invariant identification, confluence checks, rewriting systems, and identifying blocks (counterexamples)). I guess such an environment could created for projects like gymnasium. </li>\n<li>As for automated law discovery in batch processing mode -- even if that's not possible atm, we could develop an agent that can do it. That'd involve candidate generation, batch processing, continuous learning. I believe in agents and curriculum learners (ie. those kind of lifelong learners that would generate their own knowledge bases and provide their insights via APIs).</li>\n<li>When it comes to 10, I love the idea of generalizing those kinds of constructions. One could bootstrap the algorithm with the template, and let the agent work on the template. Certain types of trees could potentially \"fit\" certain types of equation characteristics. </li>\n<li>I think compute is quite tricky when it comes to such projects. I tried to run DeepSeek Prover 1.5, but then one always needs enough space and compute. I think having access to a server with enough compute via SSH would help. One could run lots of experiments and test models.</li>\n<li>New architectures like differential transformer (better attention while cancelling noise, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258</a>) could lead to the models getting better much faster (soon enough). It could be a good idea to build an agentic math framework that could eventually deal with other types of problems too.</li>\n</ol>",

It would not surprise me if some of these ideas spread out to magmas. And of course if you run into a definition in group cohomology which bifurcates in this way (can be written in more than one way for magmas) then you just choose the way which is most useful for your application. I'd stick to low degree (n=1,2) for now, there are examples of theories (eg when M is nonabelian) where things get pretty hairy after that.</p>",
