One interesting, though not particularly surprising, thing I observed here is that vampire begins to really slow down. For example, the implication 23635=&gt;2 takes around a second on my laptop to find and the resulting vampire proof is &gt;100 steps. For implications to Eq2 of order &lt;= 4, the slowest vampire run takes ~0.01s and has &lt;50 steps.</p>\n<p>Using finite magmas from the repository, as well as some I found on my own, I found 38,318 laws satisfied by a finite model. Another interesting-though-not-surprising observation here is that, if I am interpreting mace4 output correctly, I found 3 order 5 laws (modulo duality and equivalence class) that are satisfied by magmas of minimum size 17--mace4 was able to find these 3 examples quickly so they may just be the easiest examples to resolve. Note that unlike the implications above, I have not formalized this result so there is the possibility of an error.</p>\n<p>This leaves 172 laws. Of those, 106 finite imply equation 2.</p>\n<p>Group 1: In 10/106 cases, vampire's decision procedures terminates without finding an implication to equation 2, meaning they are inequivalent. These are Austin laws, though the non-implication from vampire can not be formalized. According to vampire, all laws in this set also do not imply each other so they are all inequivalent. Note that Kisielewicz's second Austin law, 28770, is among this set. (Vampire's decision procedure also concludes for his order 6 Austin law.)</p>\n<p>Group 2: In 96/106 cases, vampire's decision procedure for implication to equation 2 does not terminate, so it is unclear if these laws permit infinite models. According to our experience in order &lt;= 4, if an implication exists vampire is able to find it, so this indicates that these laws should allow infinite models, though it's not clear if this intuition about vampire's behavior continues to hold in order 5. Vampire's decision procedure also does not terminate when trying to establish equivalence between any laws in this set. Note that equation 5093, mentioned by Kisielewicz as a possible Austin law, is this in set.</p>\n<p>Group 3: The remaining 66 reduce to 25 modulo duality and equivalence class. Of those, Vampire concludes that 1 of the 25 does not imply equation 2, though it's not clear if it allows finite models or not. For the remaining 24, I don't know if they permit finite or infinite models. There are some equivalence classes and a few implications between laws in this set.</p>\n<p>Part of my motivation for doing this work was testing finite implications against a larger/different set. I have some ideas for finding finite implications from group 3 that I've been testing, but this has yielded nothing so far. All of the finite implications were found using the same methods from order &lt;= 4.</p>",

Each result appears 17 times in the multiplication table, so none is obviously distinguished. But one of the elements is idempotent, call it u.  Then note that orbits of Ru have length 8 so call the elements of one orbit 0,…,7, and the other 8,…,15, then notice some cyclicity in each block, namely most i*j are i+f(j-i) mod 8 (with a different f for the various blocks).  Finally return to an early observation that Lu∘Ru∘Ru is the identity; notice that for all x, there exists y such that Ly∘Rx∘Rx is the identity, and note how x,y are related.  Then relabel 0,…7 into even numbers 0,…,14, and 8,…,15 into odd numbers 1,…,15, with shifts, to make it so that L(x+1 mod 16)∘Rx∘Rx is the identity.  Then realize that Z/16Z could be the group of units of the field F17, and try the 8 possible isomorphisms and something popped out.</p>",

The superposition calculus is (refutation) complete, but the algorithms implementing it while trying to be efficient must be fair in order to guarantee completeness. I see from the paper that they have actually checked fairness for Vampire!</p>\n<p>In contrast, although Prover9 is also based on saturation (theoretically uses the Otter algorithm), <a href=\"https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/manual/2009-11A/inf-rules.html\">its manual</a> says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The resolution and paramodulation inference rules are intended to be complete [...], but we have not done a rigorous analysis of the algorithms, so users should not make any assumptions about completeness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in fact, I have noticed the following while using it: Sometimes Prover9 terminates with the message \"Exhausted: no\" which I believe should be interpreted as \"(pretended) saturation achieved without finding a proof\" (the terminations by time limit, memory limit, etc. have corresponding exit messages), what would mean that the implication is false. This usually happens with the default parameters, but if I give it more resources (more memory and larger limits for weight, sos number, demod step, demod size), then suddenly it runs much longer on the same problem and apparently doesn't reach saturation (usually reaches the time limit), which I think doesn't make sense if it really reached saturation with more stringent limits (unless someone has a rational explanation for this!).</p>",

If we take x*y=ax+by+c and expand the equation (in the commutative ring ℤ[a,b,c]) we should get a few polynomial equations on a,b,c, and the question becomes whether a certain ideal is all of ℤ[a,b,c] or not, which I think is decidable?  (Keywords may include Groebner bases, but I'm rusty on that.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think for order 4 laws the situation was just that no one wrote code to convert a law into a polynomial equation and do the relevant Groebner basis calculation, but an exhaustive search over small-ish p was pretty fast, and since the polynomial equations end up having pretty small degree and small coefficients there must be a solution with small p if there is any solution. For laws of larger order one might need larger primes and so exhaustive search might be infeasible, in which case going to polynomial algebra would be a good idea.</p>",

So we have a graph associated to any 21866 magma.  I think it also works for 21865 magmas and 21864 magmas (but not 21714 magmas).  I get the impression that the graph does not capture the operation completely, but it might still be useful.<br>\n<em>EDIT:</em> Some more facts.  For any <code>x</code>, <code>z</code> there must exist at least one path of length 2 between them, and one has the set equality <code>{y|x→y→z} = {x*(w*z)|w∈M}</code>.  For any path <code>x→y→z</code> one has <code>x◇(y◇z)=y</code>.  I'm convinced that there is more structure there.</p>",
