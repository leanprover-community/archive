Namely, by using a custom applier (<code>PartiallyBoundApplier</code>) they instantiate the missing pattern variables at runtime, instead of generating additional rewrite rules. The possible values for instantiation are simply all e-classes present in the e-graph before eqsat starts (cf. <code>add_rules</code> and its call site) - which yields all subexpressions of the lhs and rhs (very cool idea).</p>",
