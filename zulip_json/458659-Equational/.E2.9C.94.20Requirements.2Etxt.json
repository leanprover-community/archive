While looking around and trying to run files I found that the <code>generate_most_wanted_list.py</code> is no longer functional due to the function <code>parse_proofs_file</code> having its signature changed. If the \"most wanted list\" script is still useful enough to warrant being fixed I could try fixing it as a \"getting my feet wet\" sort of thing; if its no longer relevant then perhaps it might be worthwhile deleting it?</p>",
