From what I can reconstruct from the past discussion, when trying to set up a greedy algorithm to build interesting 118 magmas, one was forced to add about ten more rules to the greedy ruleset to maintain consistency.  These are \"local\" consequences of 118, which can be deduced by some finite number of applications of 118 that wouldn't have been picked up by a naive greedy implementation of 118 due to some \"cancelling\" going on in the applications.  (I guess by the Birkhoff completeness theorem, all consequences are local, but some are more local than others; for instance E2 is eventually a local consequence of E1689 but one would have had to perform a massive iteration of the greedy algorithm before one would have discovered that.)  Anyway, the wording of the commentary can definitely be changed.</p>",

This isn't incredibly satisfying to me, but the problem is that even in the non-associative realm, power-associativity is strongly desired as a nice property, and many, perhaps even most, classes of non-associative structures are power-associative or at least cube-associative.  After all, non-associative disciplines often focus on structures with weaker forms of associativity, and cube-associativity is implied by nearly all of these.  Note that even commutativity implies the flexible identity, which implies cube-associativity, and even idempotence implies cube-associativity.  I'm somewhat doubtful that there is even enough literature to establish any kind of convention, in this light.</p>\n<p>However, lacking an authoritative reference, I instead decided to see if there's a pattern among the nomenclature for identities with only one term of the form x(yz) or (xy)z, or two terms both of the same form...<br>\n<strong>equations supporting x(yz) having left affinity</strong>: 8, 16, 47, 75, 308, 316, 323, 327, 411, 513, 562, 3254, 3306<br>\n<strong>equations supporting x(yz) having right affinity</strong>: 10, 13, 62, 336, 463, 508, 3349<br>\n<strong>equations supporting both affinities</strong>:  9, 14, 48, 412, 4362, 4369, 4673</p>\n<p>This is not by any means conclusive, and I am not satisfied with the results of my search, but I do think the indirect precedent leans towards calling x * (x * x) the left cube, and mutatis mutandis for right cubes and higher powers, etc., despite the absence of any <em>explicit</em> reference I can find.</p>",
