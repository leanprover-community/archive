Every current co-author has already \"opted in\" to the collaboration by submitting a collaboration PR that was accepted by the github repo (though in a few cases when the coauthor did not use github, I submitted such a PR on their behalf with their consent), but I suppose a second \"opt in\" for the actual journal submission is reasonable, especially given that it is already 30/34 complete.</p>",
