        "content": "<p>It is somewhat hubristic to start talking about the future of the project when it is only three days old, but I wanted to have a place to record thoughts on this topic well in advance of when they would actually become a reality.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that once we accomplish the primary goals of this project, there are many further things one could then do with this platform and data set.  So I wanted to collect ideas of what else could be done after the primary goal (and in some cases, partially concurrently with achieving that goal).  Here are some suggestions to get the ball rolling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explore triple relations of the form \"Equation X and Equation Y implies Equation Z\".  This was for instance proposed by Pace Nielsen in <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/#comment-685891\">this blog comment</a>, and I think elsewhere as well. This will be harder for several reasons, most notably because 3-SAT is way harder than 2-SAT, but the relations we obtain in this project will help reduce the problem significantly.  As Pace suggests, we may have to cut down to just three operations instead of four to obtain a feasible project.</li>\n<li>See if there is a shorter equation than the six-operation Kisielewicz law <code>(((y ∘ y) ∘ y) ∘ x) ∘ ((y ∘ y) ∘ z) = x</code> that has the property that it has non-trivial models, but that they are all infinite.  (The proof of this claim been formalized in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/equations/pull/58\">equations#58</a>, which should be merged soon.)  Presumably it will become easy to figure out which four-operation laws have finite or infinite models when our project is complete; no idea how challenging searching the five-operator space will be, though.</li>\n<li>Once the implication graph is complete, it would be interesting to see how machine learnable it is.  Could an AI glance at an implication and make a good guess whether it is true or false?  </li>\n<li>One could gamify some aspect of the task of completing the implication graph.  One could imagine a web site that serves up a random implication or anti implication, and one has to play some version of the natural number game to resolve it.  This could have some pedagogical value.  (It occurs to me that this would also make a rather sadistic CAPTCHA.)</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>I’d like to propose two points I/we could write a few paragraphs about in the upcoming article on the project, provided others agree they're worth including.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong></p>\n<p>The majority of counterexamples were discovered using automated tools like SMT solvers, ATP, and similar (I think the largest of the 740 currently in All4x4Tables are from the brute force enumerator, then  Mace4, then Vampire). Not only that, but a large number of the crucial implication proofs were also handled through ATP!</p>\n<p>Had this project started years earlier, when first-order ATP tools weren't so good, I think we still would have filled in the implication table over time, perhaps even with more insight than the \"deploy Vampire\" approach. But the success of the ATP tools points to a Sutton-style \"<a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf\">bitter lesson</a>\" for these sorts of universal algebra problems.</p>\n<p>In the first days of the Equational Theories Project, there were many interesting suggestions for developing metatheory that would settle large batches of anti/implications uniformly (these should be gathered). But the automated tools worked so efficiently, the project's set aim was largely achieved way before these ideas could really bear their mathematical fruit! This even applies to the recent algebraic-geometric insights: if our search was just a tiny bit more effective, it might have been missed altogether, as the quadratics-based approach was swamped out by SMT-generated counterexamples initially!</p>\n<p>Where does that leave us? I think developing tools (potentially AI-based tools) which extract useful mathematical insights from first-order proofs found by ATP proves would be valuable. Right now, we have a load of Vampire proofs, but we don't fully understand which ones hold valuable insights. Even if none are currently groundbreaking, I bet there are a few future Tricki entries hiding in there. This being mentioned in the article could set things up for grant proposals to do exactly that, or to get AI companies interested in insight mining.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong></p>\n<p>The second, related to the first, is a paragraph or two about semi-handmade counterexamples, as described in e.g. the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Counterexamples.20by.20Enumerating.20Words.20in.20Quotient.20Magma\">13x13 counterexample thread</a>. I invested a fair bit of search-based, but ultimately manual effort in finding counterexamples, and I think I am not the only one. I think it's important to a.) document the type of human-machine teamwork mentioned in the linked thread while it still exists; b.) since in the spirit of the bitter lesson, automated tools <em>could</em> easily integrate these methods. Indeed, developing tools which have these strategies is something that should appear in ATP grant proposals shortly!</p>",

One could imagine several forks of this project in the future where other magma-like theories are studied.  Our existing implication graph could be somewhat useful in any other project of this type, as it instantly lists all the short laws one can deduce from any single short law in their axiom set (provided that law involves only one binary operation), although presumably most of the interesting consequences come from combinations of multiple laws and/or multiple operations, so there would still be a lot of work to do.</p>",

Obviously many cases will be trivial: if an equation has an operation on either side then it will be implied by the constant law and therefore allow a model of any size. And if it's of the form \"x = W\" with the right or left-most variable x then it will be implied by one of the absorptive laws and also have a model of any size.

original magma does.  By Taylor expanding to higher order one obtains a tower of cohomological extensions, with the cocycles being polynomials of increasingly high degrees. If the magma is not just smooth, but analytic and connected, then any law that is satisfied by all levels of this tower will also be satisfied by the original magma thanks to analytic continuation.  So the connected analytic magma is effectively an \"inverse limit\" of this tower.  </p>\n<p>If there are no idempotents, then the smooth magma operation on <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">M</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">M</span></span></span></span> induces a magma on the tangent<br>\nbundle <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">TM</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">TM</span></span></span></span> which is basically a piecewise linear extension of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">M</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">M</span></span></span></span> that obeys exactly the same laws that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">M</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">M</span></span></span></span> does (note that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">M</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">M</span></span></span></span> is a submagma of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">TM</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">TM</span></span></span></span>).  Further Taylor expansion gives further extensions into jet spaces that are of a \"piecewise cohomological\" flavor.  </p>\n<p>So basically smooth magmas are like special types of cohomological or piecewise linear magmas.  They could theoretically be useful constructions (the compatibility conditions required to construct them are algebraic in nature and could for instance be worked out by Grobner basis type methods).  By working over finite fields instead of the reals one could probably create finite analogues for at least the Taylor approximants to these magmas; but for the specific problem of resolving 677-&gt;255 for finite magmas, the implication is immune to these sorts of extensions, and so these magmas might only be useful as a new type of base model.</p>",
