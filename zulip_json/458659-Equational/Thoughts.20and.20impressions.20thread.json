        "content": "<p>I am thinking that for posterity (in particular, in a future paper reporting on the outcomes of this project) it would be good to have a thread in which we record, in approximate real time, our impressions of the project as it evolves.  For PFR we had a <a href=\"#narrow/stream/412902-Polynomial-Freiman-Ruzsa-conjecture/topic/Project.20completed!.20.20Thoughts.20and.20reflections.3F\">retrospective thread</a> after completing the primary goals, but I would like to get ahead of the game and try to record thoughts and impressions while they are still fresh.  I will make some observations below, and plan to return to this thread regularly to add more thoughts as they arise; meanwhile I encourage all other participants to also add thoughts whenever they come to mind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial response has been quite enthusiastic, and the pace is significantly faster than I envisaged.  The project is receiving a lot of technical support at the back end, and formalization and mathematical tasks are being completed extremely rapidly.  Here I think this project has an advantage over other Lean projects in that the atomic tasks to complete are very small and most of them do not require extensive expertise in either Lean or math.</li>\n<li>It was important early on to have an agreed upon numbering system for the equations under study, which will hopefully stay stable for the duration of the primary goal of the project.  Even refactoring eleven equations led to a lot of typos, I am glad I did not postpone the standardization of the numbering system until the project beame far larger!</li>\n<li>While automated tools, e.g., for autocompleting graph implications, will be absolutely necessary as the project scales larger, in the immediate term it seems that manual management of the project (e.g., through the now-standard \"outstanding task\" thread, and also through manual updating of the latest version of the Hasse diagram) is working for now.  In the very short term, it's easier to deploy humans than to deploy automated tools <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span> </li>\n<li>Having some API for Magma relations will eventually be helpful.  We are already beginning to see some general statements about equational laws (e.g., the observation that any equation of the form <code>x = f(y,z,w,u)</code> is equivalent to the equation <code>x=y</code>) that might be worth formalizing, but with our current setup we can only handle a few equational laws at a time.</li>\n<li>The existing infrastructure of github, zulip, blueprint, and also my blog, is holding up well so far.  I anticipate some scaling issues as the project gets bigger, though.</li>\n<li>This is perhaps invisible to other users, but I am finding Github Copilot <em>very</em> useful for the mundane task of entering in new Lean theorems to prove, or updating the blueprint to incorporate the latest PR'ed results.  Basically it provides an easy way to translate between Lean and LaTeX: for instance to convert Lean to LaTeX I paste in the Lean code as a comment, start typing the LaTeX, and it usually autocompletes to what I want, particularly if several examples of similar text is already in the file.  The text in both Lean and LaTeX is very standardized (to assist in machine readability), and this seems to increase the effectiveness of Github Copilot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's all my thoughts for now.  More later, but in the meanwhile please feel free to add your own comments in this thread.</p>",

The new Github project/issues workflow to manage tasks like completing the subgraph of implications is significantly more convenient on my end than the older approach of manually updating an \"Outstanding tasks\" thread, which was becoming extraordinarily time-consuming.  It is perhaps too early to say for certain, but at this point I would recommend other collaborative Lean projects transition over to a Github project for task management.</li>\n<li>I wanted to highlight a very insightful <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/#comment-685895\">comment on my blog</a> from Tristan Stérin (founder of the BusyBeaver challenge) on how to manage these sorts of \"high-entropy\" crowdsourced formal projects.</li>\n<li>Once we have automated tools to compile all the known implications and anti-implications from all submitted Lean files, and some way to display this data in various formats on the main web pages of the project, it seems that we can decentralize the operation of the project quite significantly; while some subprojects such as the Subgraph project would still require some central direction, I think we could be ready to open the door to arbitrary groups using arbitrary approaches to generate new portions of the implication graph, without the need for much coordination (other than what is listed in the new <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file).</li>\n<li>I am looking forward to seeing how the <code>proof_wanted</code> approach to capturing all non-Lean contributions to the implication graph (both human-generated and computer-generated) integrates with the Lean contributions (formalized via <code>theorem</code> rather than <code>proof_wanted</code>).  Figuring out a viable general workflow to combine formal contributions, human contributions, and other computer-generated contributions (such as AI-generated contributions) has been one of my main motivations for this project.</li>\n</ul>",

On the first day or two most of the progress came from human formalizers,  at a scale that could be managed by human organizers.  Now, on day 3, the relatively simple coded algorithms are generating data, roughly in time for the automated organizational tools to come on line.  The automated provers are just beginning enter the arena, and by the time we have the full infrastructure to accept, visualize, and analyze very large contributions, I expect the AI tools will also be ready.

This thread would be a good place for other participants to report on any progress not otherwise mentioned here, especially that which would be relevant to various other components of the project. (I guess this would be called a \"stand-up meeting\" in software engineering?)</li>\n<li>For instance, I was delighted to recieve <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/116\">equational#116</a> from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"557192\">@Franklin Pezzuti Dyer</span>  in which two old Putnam problems, which essentially asked to establish three implications between laws already in the database, were added to <code>Subgraph.lean</code>.  I have since added them to the blueprint as well, and will also update the Hasse diagram accordingly.</li>\n<li>As another spinoff activity, in <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/80\">equational#80</a> we managed to find a formula for the number of equational laws with <code>n</code> operations (up to relabeling, symmetry, and triviality), and will submit the resulting sequences to the OEIS.  Technically this will be the first external output of this project!  Also, since the proof of these formulae is already in the blueprint, I am planning to open some tasks to formalize their proofs in Lean, since the infrastructure to do so (as well as a suitable pool of contributors) is already in place...</li>\n<li>Speaking of which, I certainly plan to write a paper on this project, probably submitted to a journal on formalized mathematics, which will discuss both the mathematical results of the project but also the workflow and experiences.  This is still well into the future, after the primary goal of our project is completed, but I again encourage participants (or just casual observers) to share their impressions on this thread, as this may end up being part of the final paper.  (See <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8361\">this similar retrospective paper</a> on the Polymath8 project for a possible model.)</li>\n<li>The task management workflow is now quite a painless experience for me, freeing up my time to deal with other aspects of the project, such as discussing how to transition smoothly from the current \"semantic\" Equation-based foundation of the project to a \"syntactic\" Law-based foundation.

Writing down the list was a tricky programming question that felt like it had a simple solution, and these are always fun to find. Since surprisingly nobody else had listed the equations by then, I worked on it. After doing that I saw that this project had other small and interesting puzzles: proving implications manually, figuring out which implications to prove.</li>\n<li>Some of my work has been proof-of-concept / barely working scripts: implication graph analysis, and a small file of auto-generated proofs. This is something I leaned working on software - if you put out such a proof of concept it encourages other better qualified people to work on more full and correct implementations, and on other ideas in the area. The results I got here are mixed. I feel like it caused graph analysis in Lean happen a bit earlier, but definitely had not impact on the other automation efforts.</li>\n<li>The project definitely blew up very quickly in each of the days since. Would be interesting to see some metrics about this - e.g. plotting messages or active participant in Zulip, or PRs/issues/comments in Github.</li>\n<li>There is amazing potential for beautiful visualizations of the implications graph, and maybe for other areas in the project. Once somone comes up with the right idea these will probably be implemented very quickly, and would bring the project much wider attention.</li>\n</ul>",

While there is plenty of activity on many fronts, it is beginning to decentralize quite smoothly, and I no longer feel like I have to be involved in most of the different directions here.  I mostly have been focusing on some more theoretical aspects to the project, such as slowly setting out tasks for the metatheory of equations and for formalizing the counts for the number of equations.</p>\n<p>We have already established enough easy implications from the original set of ~22 million that there are only ~3 million unsolved implications remaining (up to equivalence).  I am expecting some contributions from AI-assisted efforts to start coming in soon, as well as large-scale automated proving runs.  We have made a lot of progress in assembling a stable infrastructure to receive these sorts of new inputs, and I am looking forward to see how these (as well as other more elementary implication chasing methods) reduce the count further.  Also, we now have some data sets online with which others can start performing some data visualization and/or data analysis; hopefully there will be some interesting features to the implication graph that we will start to see.</p>",

Looks like we are getting most of the way to having an automated generation of implications, statistics, and visualizations set up, which will be useful both for contributors who want to conduct runs on the remaining outstanding implications, and also for more casual observers who could use some \"eye candy\" and quick summaries of progress.  Also, I hope that now we have a few partial data sets, that some interesting data visualization and data analysis from new participants will emerge.</p>\n<p>Much of the time I devoted to the project today was over \"big-endian/little-endian\" type issues, such as which orientation of ordering on laws (or Hasse diagrams) to use, or which symbol to use for the Magma operation.  In informal mathematics these are utterly trivial problems, but for a formal project it is important to settle on a standard, and it is much easier to modify that standard early in the project rather than later.  So this is the sort of task that has to happen now.  I am finding the polling feature of Zulip to be useful for this, and hopefully this type of participation will help decentralize the project and help the contributors feel like they are active stakeholders.</p>\n<p>I did have some speculation over at <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"458659\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Ideas.20for.20unknown.20implications\">#Equational &gt; Ideas for unknown implications</a>  regarding a possible future \"assembly line\" type workflow in which different teams work independently on sequentially connected components of the project, but perhaps we have not yet scaled up our infrastructure and participation to reach that point yet.</p>",

A quick thank you to everyone I've interacted with, including fellow mathematicians, repo maintainers and onlookers: it's been great collaborating with all of you.</p>\n<p>I thought I'd write down a few short highlights, so I'll be able to remember if someone asks me how I felt working on this project in spring 2024. Hopefully, some of you will enjoy reading it.</p>\n<p><strong>Some things I enjoyed</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Asterix</strong>: I was probably the first to attempt constructing countermodels for <code>65-&gt;...</code>, and ended up getting crushed like the Romans. I mentioned a <code>65-&gt;...</code> unknown to Daniel Weber as a possible source of counterexamples when he initially suggested that all remaining unknowns might resolve false. Watching Joseph Myers, Pace Nielsen, Will Sawin, Daniel Weber, and Terence Tao collaborate on it was impressive, and Tao eventually built a model. The techniques they developed (translation-invariant magmas, greedy constructions) are now essential to the current refutations. For instance, the magmas I used to refute the remaining implications from 1659, 1661, and 1701 are all modified translation-invariant magmas. Bernhard Reinke's countermodel that refuted the implications from 1648 is also a bona fide translation-invariant magma. Pace Nielsen's yet-to-be formalized proof is a greedy construction. I do have a bit of regret that I did not join in on the <code>65-&gt;...</code> effort, but after working on it previously, I had enough, and I was also busy developing the Finite Magma Explorer at the time, so I guess I had a valid excuse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Central groupoids</strong>: I added a Lean definition of Knuth's A2, a nonnatural central groupoid, and following Terence Tao's advice, used it to settle anti-implications of the form <code>168 -&gt; ...</code>. Central groupoids turned out to be fascinating structures, and somewhat aligned with my own research interests, so I expect to revisit them later. Bhavik Mehta has since implemented natural central groupoids, and I'm eager to see them added to the repository!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>All4x4Tables</strong>: Working with Nicholas Carlini, Joachim Breitner, and others on All4x4Tables was a highlight. The moment when outcomes.png finally turned dark red from bright pink after re-integrating Joachim Breitner's transitive closure pruning with my planning script, became one of my favorite moments from this project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some things I look forward to</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Will there be a clear countermodel for 1112-&gt;8? Besides the 65-&gt;... family, this was another that gave me a hard time, and I'd really like to see a straightforward countermodel this time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a true unknown in the current set? I agree with the others now that there probably isn't, but I'm still curious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does the full implication graph have nontrivial automorphisms apart from duality?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some tools I loved</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vampire</strong>: I already knew Vampire was good, but it exceeded my expectations anyway. Not only did it handle the hardest implication proofs, but it also excelled at generating large finite counterexamples, far beyond what I expected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Elm</strong>: Building the Finite Magma Explorer in Elm was a breeze. And I think the FME turned out great with it: the only bug reported so far turned out to be in the high-performance JavaScript worker.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Graphiti</strong>: I ended up using Graphiti more than any other tool in the repositories, including the ones I built. It really helped me focus on meaningful implications. Without Graphiti, I doubt I would have built the three infinite models that together reduced the unknown count by hundreds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lean 4</strong>: I'm not new to interactive theorem proving by any means: I formalized the main theorem of my PhD thesis, worked a lot with Isabelle/HOL at CSIRO, contributed to HOL4 and previously briefly used Lean3 as well. This was my first time using Lean 4, however, and it turned out to be a massive improvement over Lean 3. It still won't become my primary proof assistant, but I agree that it's a really good fit for this project, and I'm happy to see such progress from its earlier version.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some things I still plan to do</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Add linear magmas to the Finite Magma Explorer. I may also port the FME's filtering feature to the Equation Explorer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contribute various sections/paragraphs to the article.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want something done, and think I'm the best person for the job, by all means ping me here or on the Github issue. I won't have much time, but I'll have a bit, and this will help me prioritize.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

But 917 implies 817, so in principle just one question needs to be resolved.</li>\n<li>1323 cluster: A \"mirror\" verson of Ramanujan, but it just has two open implications: 1323 =&gt; 2744 and its dual.</li>\n<li>1516 cluster: Again, just two open implications (down from four): 1516 =&gt; 255 and its dual.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the number of questions we have to resolve is somewhere between six and eight. In terms of raw numbers of questions to resolve, perhaps 854 has now overtaken 1485 in amount of work remaining.</p>\n<p>To continue the gaming analogy, perhaps 1485 is a \"final boss\" that we were making some significant headway defeating, but then it transformed into an even more difficult form to protect its one final open implication (up to equivalence).  We're not yet stuck on any of the five, but the remaining questions are proving highly resistant to all our previous techniques.</p>",

We do have some implications that had \"immunities\" of various types - immune to translation-invariant constructions, to linear models, or to finite models, for instance.  These immunities seem to not be strongly correlated to each other, though we haven't systematically worked this out.  The last few equations 1323, 1516, 1729 had all three immunities (translation-invariant, linear, finite) but this could just be a random alignment.  On the other hand we were stuck for a long time on 1485 (which fell to a finite model) and 854 (for which finite models could resolve some implications), so immunities don't tell the whole story.</p>\n<p>I still find 854 fascinating - it is in an unusual \"liquid\" state between \"solid\" laws that have very rigid, symmetric models and \"gaseous\" laws that have very free-form, unstructured models.  854 magmas obey a large number of other interesting laws and come with other structures, such as a directed graph and a partial ordering, that indicate structure; on the other hand one can create lots of finite models that have a lot of flexibility.  But while they have some internally interesting structure, they don't seem to be connected to more mainstream mathematical structures, which is perhaps why they have not been explored before.</p>",

Would it benefit you (or other formalizers) to have a more precise blueprint for the other equations 1076, 73, 63, 1722, 713, 1289 that can also be treated by this approach (maybe also 879, though that one seems on track to be formalized by the translation-invariant greedy method), or is the current description sufficient?  Would it make sense to try to automate this process more, or would the ad hoc approach of adapting each Lean proof for one equation to the next suffice?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think there current status is fine, but having them in the blueprint would be slightly more convenient (but that shouldn't be a big priority). As for the automatization, I can say more once I have finished 3308.  I think there is some boilerplate that can benefit from a proper lean tactic: for the completion steps in the algorithm, I start with a partial solution defined over <code>ℕ </code> and define a new partial solution over <code>ℕ ⊕ Fresh</code>, where <code>Fresh</code> is an enumerative type. This makes it easier (in particular in case 1) to verify that the new partial solution satisfies the laws again. Then I have to push down the new partial solution on <code>ℕ ⊕ Fresh</code> to a solution on  <code>ℕ </code> along a bijection between <code>ℕ </code> and  <code>ℕ ⊕ Fresh</code>. The fact that I can move partial solutions along equivalences of types is something that is reminiscent of the <code>transfer</code> tactic in lean3. Maybe this can be made in a proper <code>lean4</code> tactic again.</p>",

When it fails to find a proof, that candidate possibly runs for 10h (unless there is some memory or similar exception). I have 17 candidates like that already (a several days run). But since for this candidate a proof was found, the search lasted less than 10h (I didn't track how much). A new search for the proof, with parameters better suited for this particular candidate, has lasted 970s (so 16 minutes more or less). It may be also interesting that this is a proof in two steps: A -&gt; B, A &amp; B -&gt; C  turns out to be much better than A -&gt; C (at least with the same parameters).</p>",

Although I have some undergrad level mathematics education, being an engineer, I'm really just following and participating in this project as an enthusiast. I find mathematics research fascinating from an outside-looking-in perspective and am the kind of person that is really grateful for e.g. Quanta Magazine for making topics in pure math research accessible to the lay person (being one myself).</p>\n<p>For me, the most beautiful thing about this project is its openness. Reading articles about mathematics research paints a picture of how it is done, but leaves a lot to the imagination. It is clear that a large fraction of cooperation between mathematicians happens in relative closed fora, be it email conversations or in-person meetings.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with the collaborative work we see going on here, in threads like <a href=\"#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/FINITE.3A.20677.20-.3E.20255\">#Equational &gt; FINITE: 677 -&gt; 255</a>. Seeing the details of how mathematical arguments are shared and iterated on in real time, with false starts, dead ends, negative results, and all, is enlightening for me. It makes me understand a lot more about how the frontier of mathematics is pushed forward.</p>\n<p>This is interesting to me as an enthusiast, but I think it is providing much broader value beyond satisfying my intellectual curiosity. To young aspiring mathematicians, I believe the communication here is leading by example in terms of how to conduct research in general and collaborative research specifically. It paints an honest picture of the hard work one often needs to put in before one arrives at a positive result. This can be lacking in a more traditional workflow where all you often see is the final published paper proving some result.  It also illustrates quite effectively how much can be achieved when passionate researchers share ideas and build upon each other's work in a relatively selfless manner, and it gives a concrete example of what that can look like.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this Zulip channel makes explicit immense amounts of knowledge that would remain tacit if the only artifact this project produced was a paper and some lean code. I have a feeling that this is democratizing a lot of expert knowledge in a relatively effective way. I imagine this is particularly true for a lot of the negative results that might be hard to publish by traditional means.</p>\n<p>Finally I want to commend the professional mathematicians participating so publicly in this project. For some I imagine it can be quite a change from what one is used to. Working in public means you are showcasing not only your best work but also your mistakes and flaws. This can require a certain amount of confidence, I am sure. But, following my reasoning above, I think you are all doing a great service to the field. Thank you!</p>",

In a hypothetical alternate universe where we were trying to complete the Equational Theories Project without a formal proof assistant language such as Lean, I would like to believe that when the time came to write the (now much lengthier) paper (which would roughly speaking correspond to the current blueprint), there would be someone checking the proofs and catching the issues (some of which were simply typos or bad communication, but some of which did require non-trivial fixes to the structure of the argument).  But I think that because we knew that the proofs would be formalized in Lean eventually, that this sort of careful human checking was not really done for this particular implication, especially since it was one of the last implications to be resolved, and so understanding the proof in fine detail in order to apply it to remaining implications was not as important as with earlier proofs in the project (where for instance deconstructing the early greedy algorithm arguments was very helpful in deploying versions of that argument to other implications).</p>\n<p>This implication is one of the most complex implications obtained in the whole project (only the 1729-&gt;817 one is more complex, I think).  There are certainly many simpler implications where a proposed proof was given, and then retracted after someone else in the project pointed out a difficulty well before any attempt at formalization, but this one I think reaches a threshold of complexity where casual \"peer review\" of the other participants was too challenging.  Part of that was my fault when writing up the blueprint; I did not break things up into atomic lemmas in a manner suitable for modular inspection of the argument, but instead described a rather complicated greedy algorithm as a large sequence of adjustments to a simpler algorithm, which was closer to how I arrived at the algorithm in the first place, but not ideal for verification.</p>",

I actually only realized these issues when the formalization was almost done. Partly because they happened to be in the parts of the proof we tackled last, and partly because I was hoping that formalizing the rest would give me some new insight to fix them autonomously.</p>\n<p>We did review the proofs before starting the formalization, but it was mostly to understand the general strategy and figure out how to approach the formalization, so we weren’t as thorough as we would’ve been if we weren’t planning to go over every detail when translating it into Lean anyway.</p>\n<p>I’m sure we could’ve caught issue 3 with a more careful review, but I’m less confident about 2. There were a lot of cases to check (in the last implementation, there were at least 8, since the 3 hypotheses introduced structures that could each take 2 forms). On top of that, some of those cases needed to be split even further. Out of all of them, only one case was explicitly mentioned in the informal proof (and that one worked fine), and just 2 cases ended up being problematic. For the rest, it wasn’t too hard to show that either the hypotheses became contradictory or the result was true anyway. So, I think without the formal framework, it would’ve been easy for this mistake to slip through a review.</p>\n<p>As for how tricky the problems were: apart from issue 1, which was easy to fix, the other two weren’t straightforward—at least for us. That might be because we didn’t have much experience with similar proofs, as we did not contribute to other greedy proofs, and as Terry pointed out earlier, this proof was already pretty complicated. So it’s also possible we were just a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of both the proof and the greedy structure implementation.</p>",

On the Lean side, there are still two difficult anti-implications to be formalized, and I imagine that that process might also run into March, and even after that there might be some refactoring to get a satisfactory \"end to end\" theorem in Lean that really does completely formalize the description of the implication graph without using any human-proved but not formalized results (e.g., duality).  But that would definitely be the endgame stage where we would like to wrap up the paper writing while our memories of the project are still relatively fresh.</p>",
