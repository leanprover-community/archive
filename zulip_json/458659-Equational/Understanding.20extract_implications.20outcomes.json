Since the arrays are really really large and very hard to view was thinking it might be easier if instead of working with magma upto order 4 if <code>extract_implications</code> had an option to accept the order value as an option.  I don't expect anyone to make the changes but just want to check that the only things that need to be adjusted are the input from the two files</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>equations.txt</code></li>\n<li><code>duals.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also realize that EquationalResult.lean could use another value to hold the size of the order <br>\nor to filter out  items from the list based on the attribute in <code>extract_implications</code> before processing.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
