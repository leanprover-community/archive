We welcome feedback, questions, etc. <del>It is the PR 'Invariant based metatheorem blueprint'</del>. You can find it in the blueprint, chapter 7. </p>\n<p>The chapter describes a technique to produce metatheorems of the form \"An equation w=w' is <em>good</em> if Invariant(u) = Invariant(v). Then good equations cannot imply non-good equations\". Here Invariant(u) is some sort of data type associated with u.
