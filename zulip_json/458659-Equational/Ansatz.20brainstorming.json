(I am sad that PORC approach seemed to be mostly a bust.) We have a few implications that were resolved through a clever operation that was linear over involving x, y, and sign(x-y), over the naturals or integers. Trying to generalize this, maybe one could write an ansatz that is _piecewise linear_ over its domain, where the pieces are defined by linear relations. This could be over N, Z, Z^2, etc. So something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a11</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a12</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a13</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">v11</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v12</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v13</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">else</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a21</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a22</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a23</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">v21</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v22</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v23</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">vN1</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">vN2</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">vN3</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Just taking N=2 or N=3 I think already includes some interesting cases. This includes arbitrary \"fixups\" on small values as a special case, because one can always cut off any lattice point with enough linear relations.</p>\n<p>There's the question of how amenable this could be to computer search, though. The <code>if</code>s mean it's not easy to work with it directly to solve for the coefficients. The way I could imagine going about this is plugging in some values, committing to certain branches, and then solving the resulting integer program.</p>\n<p>For example, with 1323, this could look like: I plug x=5 and y=10 into x = y ◇ (((y ◇ y) ◇ x) ◇ y). Each of those 4 operations, there are (with N=2) two ways for the if statements to go, so 16 possible linear expressions. The resulting equation will involve the \"v\" variables, and then there's 4 side conditions involving \"a\" and \"v\" variables that need to be satisfied. You do this for several points and try to find a model that satisfies all of these at once .. and, ideally, does not satisfy some other equation.</p>\n<p>It's not a particularly easy ansatz form to work with, but I think it's still amenable to computerized search up to some moderate size, and I'm hopeful for it.</p>\n<p>I'm titling this channel as I am because I'm wondering if anyone has other ideas for general ansätze to try on the remaining hard problems.</p>",
