Here is one framework, in which one abstracts the partial magma operation <code>x ◇ y = z</code> into a ternary relation <code>R(x,y,z)</code>.  The language is then that of a single sort with the ternary relation <code>R</code> and three constants <code>a,b,c</code>, obeying the following general base axioms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>c != a</code> and <code>c != b</code>. (This is part of <code>c</code> being novel.)</li>\n<li>If <code>R(x,y,z)</code> and <code>R(x,y,z')</code>, then <code>z=z'</code>.  (i.e., the relation is given by a partial magma operation.)</li>\n<li>If <code>R(x,y,z)</code>, then either <code>x != a</code> or <code>y != b</code>.  (i.e., <code>a ◇ b</code> is undefined.)</li>\n<li>If <code>R(x,y,z)</code>, then <code>x != c</code>, <code>y != c</code>, and <code>z != c</code>.  (This is the other part of <code>c</code> being novel.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then, for each law one wants to study, there will be additional axioms placed on top of this.  For instance, in the case of the 1076 analysis, one adds the following axioms:</p>\n<p>(0') If <code>R(x,y,w)</code>, <code>R(x,w,u)</code>, and <code>R(u,y,z)</code>, then <code>R(y,z,x)</code>.<br>\n(1') If <code>R(x,y,z)</code>, <code>R(x,z,w)</code>, <code>R(x',y,z')</code>, <code>R(x',z',w)</code>, then <code>x = x'</code>.<br>\n(2') If <code>R(x,y,w)</code> and <code>R(x,w,y)</code>, then <code>R(y,w,y)</code>.<br>\n(3') If <code>R(x,y,w)</code>, <code> R(x,w,y)</code>, <code>R(z,y,u)</code>, and <code>R(z,u,x)</code>, then <code>y=z</code>.</p>\n<p>Then one defines a new ternary predicate <code>R'</code> extending <code>R</code> by some rule.  In the case of 1076, the rules are</p>\n<p>(a) If <code>R(x,y,z)</code>, then <code>R'(x,y,z)</code>.<br>\n(b) One has <code>R'(a,b,c)</code>.<br>\n(c) If <code>R(x,b,y)</code> and <code>R(x,y,a)</code>, then <code>R'(b,c,x)</code>.</p>\n<p>We set <code>R'(x,y,z)</code> to be false if none of (a), (b), (c) apply.</p>\n<p>One could then use an ATP to check that if <code>R</code> obeys 1-4 and (0')-(3'), then <code>R'</code> also obeys 2 and (0')-(3').</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It managed to prove this. I imagine the process using this will be to search for a contradiction each time, then study it and figure out what rule you need to add? Is there a good equation to try that on?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yes, that was my proposed workflow, though I don't know to what extent the \"figure out what rule you need to add\" step can be automated from the ATP output.  Roughly speaking one wants to find new conditions on <code>R</code> (not involving <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>) that are forced by requiring <code>R'</code> to obey all the relevant axioms, but are not already in the list of axioms one is prescribing for <code>R</code>.</p>\n<p>Oberlix (1491) seems like a good place to start, since we were halfway through doing that anyway (even though <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"762865\">@Pace Nielsen</span> has a slightly different approach that settles the anti-implication to Asterix), so may be a good warmup.  (Or one could revisit Asterix (65) or 73 just to calibrate the method.)</p>\n<p>Just going by sheer yield of implications, <a href=\"https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?511\">511</a> could be a good target - it involves only two variables, so the ability to proliferate side conditions seems somewhat under control, and I don't think it has been addressed by the confluent team.  Understanding it could resolve 12 anti-implications and their duals, and there is also another equation <a href=\"https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2338\">2338</a> that implies it that also looks like a reasonable target.

It seems that the equation 511 is surprisingly rich in structure, and yet still only has a finite (but large) number of local constraints. In particular I don't see an obvious way to shorten the verification of the greedy algorithm to a human-readable form, without some major insight into the structure of 511 magmas.</p>\n<p>Some

It seems that the equation 511 is surprisingly rich in structure, and yet still only has a finite (but large) number of local constraints. In particular I don't see an obvious way to shorten the verification of the greedy algorithm to a human-readable form, without some major insight into the structure of 511 magmas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was trying to find a major insight into 511 and (so far) did not find anything. I constructed clusters of implication patterns, and turned them into a network. From this perspective, I can only see it that 511-related patterns (<em>marked orange</em>) belong to a cluster close to the center of the network.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/iJDCmG-_IGfGgdbRjnbN4T8h/newimage.png\">newimage.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/iJDCmG-_IGfGgdbRjnbN4T8h/newimage.png\" title=\"newimage.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"6000x6000\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/iJDCmG-_IGfGgdbRjnbN4T8h/newimage.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
