And the basic ideas are pretty accessible.  </p>\n<p>Given the reach of our fearless leader, it's likely there will be some sci-news stories from the usual suspects at the official completion of the project, as there were near the start, and he's already mentioned it in some interviews.  TBH, this is one reason why it might not be the worst thing in the world if 677-&gt;255 finite remains unsolved, that's a nice story point.. and is likely to draw interest from some people with spare brain cycles or spare compute cycles, who might enjoy the challenge of dealing with the last survivor.  Then we'd get both the poetry and the eventual result without having to give up too much time! <span aria-label=\"holiday tree\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f384\" role=\"img\" title=\"holiday tree\">:holiday_tree:</span> </p>\n<p>One idea would be to put together one, or maybe several short, 3B1B-style explainers of what we did and how: the SoME math videos are pretty popular, and that's the level I had in mind.   Manim's also pretty straightforward to use, although it's one of those systems where doing some tricky things is easy and doing some trivial things is a pain.  And we'd have the finite magma game to use too.</p>\n<p>Other ideas?</p>",
