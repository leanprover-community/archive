This is with the selection options that come as default in the Windows GUI, which are selection_order 2 and selection_measure 4. Looking at the Mace4 manual, it makes more sense to me to choose selection_measure 3: \"Select the candidate that would cause the greatest number of contradictions; for each cell being considered, all assignments and subsequent propagations are done (and undone), and the number of assignments that lead directly to contradictions are counted; this is an expensive lookahead operation with the motivation of cutting off paths as soon as possible.\"</p>\n<p>With this option, Mace4 finds a contradiction in 1s and exhausts <em>all</em> models of size 7 in 3s. Similarly, huge time improvements are found with the other slow candidates too (another one that needed 1485s for one model, is now solved in 2s and exhausted in 109s).</p>",
