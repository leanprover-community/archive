If you want to propose a different PR to the one you have already proposed on a task, you need to first comment <code>withdraw PR #old_PR_number</code> on the issue first.

Then this can be followed up by a subsequent comment <code>propose PR #new_PR_number</code>. </p>\n<p>Also, please note that the there is a single space between <code>PR</code> and the number <code>#xyz</code></p>",
