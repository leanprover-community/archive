This may be useful as either a test set for CASC, or alternatively as a test set in some online library such as the <a href=\"https://tptp.org/TPTP/\">TPTP Problem Library</a>. If others think that's a good idea, Geoff Sutcliffe organizes both of those so he can probably direct what's appropriate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now that the final formalizations are in, I thought I'd bring this up again. We have generated a database of results that could perhaps be useful for the ATP community. I noticed that Geoff Sutcliffe has an account on this Zulip, so unless anyone objects, I will start a thread here in the next few days tagging him to introduce some of the results from the project that may be of use, say for CASC or TPTP. In particular, I need to brush the dust off my toolchain and figure out how many of the implications vampire can't resolve in some small/reasonable amount of time, which ones they are, and find the breakdown of how many do/don't have finite counter-examples.</p>",
