This means that if you are running with their recommended <code>[frozencache]</code> option to the package, you will need to specify a cache directory. <strong>Do not use a hidden directory name!</strong> Hidden directories begin with the special <code>.</code> character, such as <code>.minted-cache</code> (which may be the default). Such options will break at publish time, as these files are not saved between compilation and publication (and are not able to be regenerated). To account for this, do not use them. An example of a correct call looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Python\"><pre><span></span><code>  \\<span class=\"n\">usepackage</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">frozencache</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"n\">cachedir</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">minted</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">cache</span><span class=\"p\">]{</span><span class=\"n\">minted</span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This assumes that you've already correctly created the cache first using their <code>[finalizecache]</code> option. Consult the <a href=\"http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/minted/minted.pdf#page=11\">package manual</a> for further details (at time of this writing, the package options begin on page 12 in section 5).</p>\n</blockquote>",

The project successfully determined all 22 028 942 edges of the\nimplication graph between the 4694 simplest equational laws on magmas, by a\ncombination of human-generated and automated proofs, all validated by the\nformal proof assistant language Lean. As a result of this project, several new\nconstructions of magmas satisfying specific laws were discovered, and several\nauxiliary questions were also addressed, such as the effect of restricting\nattention to finite magmas.\n\\\\\n</code></pre></div>\n</div></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Files that are not used to produce the pdf should go in an <code>anc/</code> directory, so I put <code>contributions.md</code> there for the arXiv submission.</li>\n<li>Instead of <code>references.bib</code> I put the generated <code>main.bbl</code> as otherwise the HTML conversion was failing to produce a bibliography.</li>\n<li>I've reported two other issues to the arXiv about the HTML conversion.</li>\n</ul>",

Up until now we have used this open channel to coordinate the project.  However, it may make sense for discussion of the publication of the paper (and any referee reports we recieve, etc.) to move to a private channel (or group DM, email chain, etc.) involving only the co-authors of the paper.  I am not sure how to proceed on this, and would like to open a discussion regarding this (and perhaps follow up with a poll, as with previous questions of this nature).
