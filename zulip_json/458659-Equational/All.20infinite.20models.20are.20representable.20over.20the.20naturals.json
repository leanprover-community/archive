Hence we can restrict to magmas M of countably infinite cardinality.</p>\n<p>Now, get any bijection f between (M,·) and the naturals N, and use<br>\nn*m := f(f^-1(n)·f^-1(m)) as the magma product over N. Then f is an isomorphism of magmas. Hence it suffices to look for magmas over the natural numbers.</p>",
