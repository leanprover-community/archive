(Many thanks, by the way, to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"761294\">@Nicholas Carlini</span> for setting it all up!) The working name is \"Advanced Equation Implication Table\", but I've been referring to it as \"Equation Explorer\" now that it has the functionality to move from one equation to another.  Anyone else have some catchy name proposals for this tool (which I am hoping will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes on, with many useful features attached to it)?  Once we have a few candidates I could set up a poll to determine what to call it.</p>",
