It is my understanding that one can always prove true implications between universal identities via rewrites.  Contradiction is not, technically, needed.</p>\n<p>My point was that perhaps instead of searching for rewrites, one could sometimes search through counter-example options, which may, in some cases, be faster than checking possible rewrites.</p>\n<p>For example, another open implication on the list, studied by my student Katelyn Clark and me, is Eqn9 =&gt; Eqn100.  This implication is also true, and thus will be provable with some clever substitutions (essentially repeating the substitutions you gave above to get x=x^2, and then plugging that in to Eqn9 to get Eqn 100).  However, it is also easy to check it by the same argument as above, just checking options, after forcing Eqn100 to be false, and then trying to force Eqn9 to be true.</p>\n<p>Here is another example, demonstrating this idea.  Another open implication in the list is Eqn12 =&gt; Eqn4.  Eqn4 is x=xy.  Assuming this is false, then there are three cases to consider.  (A)  0 0 = 1,  (B) 0 1 = 1, or (C) 0 1 = 2 (for some distinct elements in the magma).  Eqn12 is of the form x=x(yz).</p>\n<p>First, consider Case A.  Taking x=y=z=0 in Eqn 12, we get 0 1 = 0.  Then taking x=y=0, z=1, we get 0 = 1, a contradiction.</p>\n<p>Next, consider Case B.  Taking x=y=0, z=1, we get 0 = 1, another contradiction.</p>\n<p>Finally, consider Case C.  [Indeed, we can do more, by assuming Cases A and B never occur, if we desire.]  Taking x=y=0, z=1 in Eqn 12, we get 0 2 = 0.  Then, taking x=y=0 and z=2 gives 1 = 2, another contradiction.</p>\n<p>The point of all this is that this process of searching through cases can be automated, and may be easier than searching through possible rewrites.</p>",

However, in my experience, it is much more human understandable to discover the right case analysis than to find random-looking substitutions.  So, I figured this would also hold for your question.  It took a bit more work than in the other situations handled above, but it wasn't too difficult to find a human-discoverable proof of the implication (without any reference to other sources, such as Kisielewicz's paper).  Here is a (mostly non-optimized) sketch.  I'll write products using concatenation, for ease.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First we'll show that 1689 in conjunction with xx=x yields x=y.  Taking z=x in 1689, and simplifying using constancy of squaring yields x=(yx)x.  By a change of variables, this means z=(xz)z.  Thus Equation 1689 immediately simplifies to x=(yx)z.  Taking y=x here, and simplifying using constancy of squaring, yields x=xz.</p>\n<p>We now know that the semigroup is a left zero semigroup (i.e., the argument on the left of a product always wins).  Thus 1689 transforms to x=y (since y is the left-most argument in the products on the right side of 1689).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> For the rest of the proof, we may fix distinct elements 0,1 such that <strong>00=1</strong>, and try to derive a contradiction.</p>\n<p>Case 2a: Suppose 10=0.  Taking x=z=0 and y=1 in 1689 yields 0=1.</p>\n<p>Case 2b: Suppose 10=1.  Taking x=y=z=0 in 1689 yields 0=11.  Then taking x=y=1 and z=0 yields 1=01.  Switching the roles of 0 and 1 we reduce to Case 2a.</p>\n<p>Case 2c: We must have <strong>10=2</strong>.  Taking x=y=z=0 yields <strong>0=12</strong>.  Taking x=z=0 and y=1 yields <strong>0=22</strong>.  (We now have 4 entries in our multiplication table permanently described.)</p>\n<p>We are next going to consider the product 02.</p>\n<p>Case 2ci: Suppose 02=0.  We reduce to Case 2b by renaming 0-&gt; 1 and 2-&gt; 0.</p>\n<p>Case 2cii: Suppose 02=2.  We reduce to Case 2a under the same renaming.</p>\n<p>Case 2ciii: Suppose 02=1.  Taking x=y=0 and z=2 yields 0=2.</p>\n<p>Case 2civ:  We must have <strong>02=3</strong>.</p>\n<p>Taking x=z=2 and y=0 yields <strong>2=33</strong>.  Taking x=y=z=2 yields <strong>2=03</strong>.  (We now have <del>six</del> seven fixed entries.)</p>\n<p>Finally taking x=0, y=1, and z=3 yields 0=2(23) while taking x=z=3 and y=0 yields 3=2(23), the final contradiction.</p>",
