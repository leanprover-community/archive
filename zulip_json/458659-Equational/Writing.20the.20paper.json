(One can of course still pursue additional spinoff projects, as we have already been doing for instance with the finite magmas spinoff, or make technical improvements to the codebase; but in my mind the \"official\" part of the project will wrap up once the paper is written, submitted, revised, accepted and published.)</p>\n<p>We already have several issues claimed <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/873\">equational#873</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/922\">equational#922</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/926\">equational#926</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/956\">equational#956</a> to contribute chapters or subsections to the draft that are still outstanding.  Perhaps this thread can be used for the contributors who had claimed these sections to report on their status.</p>\n<p>One of the writing issues, <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/924\">equational#924</a> (writing a section reporting on the finite magma implication spinoff project), remains unclaimed (a stub exists in the draft at Section 8).  A volunteer to claim this section also would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>I plan to go through the draft later today to update it and identify any further issues to formally make (based on several boldface comments currently in the draft).  A lot of it is in decent shape though, so I think once we have the contributed chapters we can move into the proofreading and polishing stage.  (But if anyone has any suggestions for the global structure of the paper, this thread would be a good place to discuss them.)</p>\n<p>If any contributors wish to register themselves as a participant or co-author of the project but has not yet made a <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/issues?q=label%3Acontribution+\">contributor PR</a> listing your contributions, this would be a good time to do so.  Contributors can also update their contact and contribution details in Appendix B of the paper.</p>\n<p>An obvious journal for this paper, by the way, would be the newly formed <a href=\"https://afm.episciences.org/\">Annals of Formalized Mathematics</a>, but this would also be a good time to discuss any other possible options.</p>",

For instance, I've removed the \"statistics\" section as we don't really have much to report here (but instead sprinkled some more stats about the implication graph elsewhere in the paper), and also shortened the \"Author contributions\" section since we are using the <code>contributions.md</code> file as our main source here.  (But we should include contact information and affiliation in the main paper still; if you are listed as an author but have not entered in this information, feel free to submit a PR or else DM me with the required details.)</p>\n<p>The most significant content I added was in the \"conclusions\" section (Section 13), where I proposed some lessons to draw from the project, and some future directions.  This is very much a tentative draft for this section, and I very much welcome more input to weigh in on what lessons to draw from this project.  There may be things that I omitted, or misrepresented, or perhaps are not worth saying, so any feedback would be encouraged here.</p>\n<p>I also wrote something for Section 3 (formal foundations), though I was a little unsure about some of the backend stuff (e.g., how we ended up implementing laws vs equations), so some scrutiny and corrections here would also be welcome.</p>\n<p>One section that is still completely missing is Section 12 (data management), which is something we really haven't talked about.  Presumably the Github repository will be our primary data repository going forward.  The actual data of our project, particularly the implication graph, can be accessed from Equation Explorer, though I don't think we quite have a way of converting an arbitrary edge in the graph to an actual Lean theorem yet.  Is there anything we could do to make the data we have more accessible that doesn't require an enormous amount of additional effort?</p>",

It seems like a trivial canonizer C(w)=x would match our definition, and if that's true we're clearly limited in what we can conclude.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that we can then take the image of C and endow it with a magma structure simply by<br>\ntaking w1 ⋄ w2 := C(w1 ⋄M_X w2 ). This magma refutes E ′ if C sends the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side of E′ to distinct elements of MX .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point all C has is computability and class invariance.  How do we know this image actually models E?</p>",

But actually this is stronger than what we want, which is just to <em>refute</em> implications! And indeed the Lean proofs do <em>not</em> prove this extra property, at least directly.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure I found a very standard definition of a canonizer, though I guess a case can be made that it includes this second condition, in which case we need to find another term, maybe \"weak canonizer\", though I used that elsewhere for something else.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At this point all C has is computability and class invariance. How do we know this image actually models E?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the bit I'm actually not sure about. Actually, no, I'm sure this is wrong.</p>\n<p>In the code they actually have the additional idempotence hypothesis, but that's also not enough. They just prove each special case, but there the canonizer is defined as in definition 6.7, so everything works out: <code>C_R</code> is idempotent and a morphism to the magma defined as above. The trick is that <code>R</code> actually satisfies some pretty strong conditions (the subterm and non-overlap stuff). This makes <code>C_R</code> idempotent but also respect substitutions on the image.</p>\n<p>I should note that we don't actually need this, since if <code>C</code> sends <code>E</code>- equal words to distinct terms, it's definitely a matching invariant (in the sense of 6.2) like mentioned in the previous sentence, and so we don't actually need this to be a magma satisfying <code>E</code> in the rest of the paragraph.</p>\n<p>Still I'm annoyed at the mistake, and the lean code does prove that each instance is a model for the given magmas. Maybe I can explain why it holds in this case.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, the matching invariant mentioned in Proposition 6.1 is the <em>universal invariant</em>).</p>\n<p>Second sidenote: I notice that in the following paragraph they use</p>\n<p><span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><msub><mo>∼</mo><mi>E</mi></msub><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x \\sim_E y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\"><span class=\"mrel\">∼</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3283em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">y</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>instead of</p>\n<p><span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><msub><mo>≃</mo><mi>E</mi></msub><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x \\simeq_E y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6138em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\"><span class=\"mrel\">≃</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3283em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">y</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>Should I change my notation?</p>",

something.</p>\n<p>To answer my earlier concern, the trivial mapping to a constant element is indeed a valid \"canonizer\" by 6.6, it just doesn't have any separating power as a refutation witness, because by construction there's never going to be anything different on the two sides.  So it's not a problem that it's valid, nobody ever promised every canonizer would have much proving power!  I guess that makes sense too.</p>\n<p>By way of contrast, for a explicit countermodel/model-theoretical refutation we'd need a compositional C to ensure im C models E, and 6.6 doesn't suffice.  I'm not sure whether even 6.7 does.. I've gone back and forth on whether I think 6.7 implies idempotency on its own.  Currently \"yes, via induction on subwords because of the weakly collapsing property\", but I thought I had a counterexample a while ago so I was wrong at least once!  which is one way to get from CR​(u⋄v)=R(CR​(u)⋄CR​(v)) to CR​(u⋄v)=CR​(CR​(u)⋄CR​(v)) and get a model of E.</p>\n<p>Does that make sense?</p>\n<p>I think this section could use a few sentences to clarify the storyline.</p>",

The currently quoted equation is E11232 <code>x = y ◇ ((y ◇ (y ◇ x)) ◇ (z ◇ y))</code>.  I don't have access to Kisielewicz' paper <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s000120050057\">https://doi.org/10.1007/s000120050057</a> to see if he also discusses that equation.  If anyone has access I'd be interested, if only to record all equation numbers in the commentary.</p>\n<p>Another confusion I have about the conclusion is the usage of \"surjunctive\" for the property that « maps from M to itself that are surjective are necessarily injective ».  Firstly, up to axiom of choice subtleties, this property is equivalent to finiteness.  It only stops being so if we restrict to maps that are built from the magma operation somehow.  This may be related to the usual definition of surjunctivity for groups, which appears to involve cellular automata, but I don't understand enough to fix this.  (Incidentally it is possible that the implications 3342⇒3522 and 3342⇒4118 may have surjunctive counterexamples despite holding for all finite magmas, since we use stronger properties than just surjectivity⇔injectivity.)</p>",

Also, if you have not yet updated <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/paper/contributions.md\"><code>contributions.md</code></a> with your contributions, please do so in a PR (you can see the <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/issues?q=state%3Aclosed%20label%3Acontribution\">other PRs marked \"contributions\"</a> for examples).</p>",

Things have been extraordinarily hectic on my end these days.</p>\n<p>I believe the entire GraphML section should be moved to the supplementary material. The experiments we conducted and reported there months ago are no longer particularly relevant to the main narrative of the paper. They serve more as a test of GraphML methods than as a substantive contribution to the paper itself.</p>\n<p>If you agree, I could open a PR removing that section in a few days.</p>",

(The equational theory of V is obviously decidable, since an equation E holds on all members of V iff it holds on the finitely many finite generators.)</p>\n<p>There are simple tests to determine if a quasiprimal <strong>A</strong> is idemprimal or primal, namely<br>\n1) <strong>A</strong> is idemprimal iff it is rigid (the only automorphism is the identity map on A) and any subalgebra of <strong>A</strong> that is not <strong>A</strong> is trivial (only one element);<br>\n2) <strong>A</strong> is primal iff it is idemprimal and its only subalgebra is <strong>A</strong>.</p>\n<p>The only 2-element quasiprimal magma is the Boolean algebra (with the Sheffer stroke), and it is primal.</p>\n<p>However one can distinguish quasiprimal from idemprimal from primal with 3-element magmas.

This is all great material for the philosophy of mathematics, but a rather rich diet for my tastes. (Kalmar, by the way, was the young mathematician who fixed a problem with Landau's course notes on the foundations of mathematics where Landau was falsely claiming to use the axiom of choice to define the usual operations on the natural numbers. This inspired Landau to publish his famous <em>Grundlagen der Analysis</em>.)</p>\n<p>By the way, Herstein comments towards the end of his book that the strongest form of Jacobson's result requires the Axiom of Choice, a digression that he declines to take in his book.

If Jose (or anyone else) is willing to volunteer to report on these statistics (I have currently commented out these sections for lack of content), that would be great!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I confirm I'm working on it! <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> I was redoing some experiments, and trying to synthesize what I can really say. About comparing ATPs properly I only have two small (but informative) comparisons between Vampire and Prover9, I have more info about tweaking Prover9/Mace4, comparisons between sets of parameters with specific examples. Also some basic comments on semiguidance and such, how times are improved adding other constraints, and how we integrated the ATPs with SAGE. In addition, during the project I experimented with other interesting Prover9 features like semantic guidance and addition of hints, but they didn't work for me and I don't think it is useful to say so (perhaps it was just me not doing things well enough). On the other hand, I would like to mention the isofilter bug we found, and some other basic comments regarding the GUI versus the terminal (see below), which can be useful for unaware new users (but I'm a bit hesitant about their real value for our paper, perhaps you can give your opinion about this).</p>\n<p>I have also run into some problems (for example for logistic reasons I had to use 3 different combinations of hardware/software, that I need to compare now), the biggest one being the following: the GUI uses a previous version of Prover9/Mace4 (the latest one can only be used via terminal), but in my experience it seemed to be sometimes <em>faster</em> than the latest one! This I have confirmed these days with a dramatic example: the longest Prover9 proof, found in the HN subproject (which originally needed several computation hours to be found), can be found in 8 minutes with the GUI with max_weight 300 and sos_limit 200. In startling contrast, with the same parameters, the latest version <em>fails</em> to find a proof, exhausting the search after several hours (9h in a slightly slower machine). Idk if this is due to some default parameters not being actually the same in the two versions (shouldn't be the case if I have read the manual and the GUI options correctly, which I've done carefully these days), or to an important behaviour change in the latest version with respect to the GUI one; in any case, that the behaviour is quite different is evidenced by the clauses statistics found in the output files, which differ significantly between both versions.</p>\n<p>I'd really like to be able to warn about this problem by identifying its cause (a priori, from the statistics differences one should be able to infer where the problem lies), but I fear it would imply learning the inner workings of some very specific inference processes of Prover9 (I tried to reach McCune before realizing that he sadly died in 2011... Also asked <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"763356\">@Zoltan A. Kocsis (Z.A.K.)</span> in case he knows how to identify the problem, but I think he hasn't read me yet).</p>\n<p>All in all, I think that in the end I will be happy adding several small paragraphs to the paper, so not much information, but (hopefully) interesting nonetheless.</p>",

To do that we need to know that $(C_R\\theta)a \\diamond (C_R\\theta)b$ is some substitution applied to $l$.  Note that $a$ and $b$ are proper sub-words of $l$, so if they are not variables then the fact that $R$ is non-overlapping comes into play.  But if they are variables, then something else occurs.</p>\n<p>As best as I can guess, we are now doing another induction, to claim that $C_R\\circ \\theta$ is a substitution on proper subwords of $\\ell$.  Anyway, even after that, does this mean that $C_R\\circ \\theta$ is a substitution on $r$?  Thus, the last two equalities are very hard for me to see. </p>\n<p>Maybe $C_R\\circ \\theta$ is being viewed not as the composition of two functions, but rather as the substitution generated by the map $C_R\\circ \\theta$ acting on variables?  If that's the case, a better notation might be $\\theta^{\\ast}$ for the substitution generated by $\\theta$.  Then the equality looks something like</p>\n<p><span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

In two places, replace \\subset with \\subseteq.</p>\n<p>p. 36, Definition 6.7, second bullet point.  Replace \\varphi with \\varphi_{\\theta} in one place.</p>\n<p>p. 36, Definition 6.7, fourth bullet point.  Replace R(w\\theta) with R(\\varphi_{\\theta}w) in one place.</p>\n<p>p. 36, Theorem 6.9.  When observing that r is a sub-word of l, it might be helpful to add \"since R is weakly collapsing and a weak canonizer\".</p>\n<p>Also, technically speaking, there is nothing in the definitions to prevent R from being the trivial map and from l=r.  So we don't know that r is a <em>proper</em> sub-word.  This can be easily handled a number of ways.  For instance, we could break into cases, and handle the trivial case l=r separately.  Or a nontriviality hypothesis could be added somewhere.  Or the implicit assumption l\\neq r could be added to a definition somewhere.  I personally prefer the first option; just handle the trivial case separately.</p>\n<p>p. 37, phrase \"from the above equality\".  Is this the equality in Definition 6.6(2), or some other equality?  This should probably be specified.</p>\n<p>p. 38,  in one place \\tilde{w} \\to_E \\tilde{w} appears, but the first term should have a dash on it.</p>\n<p>p. 41.  There is a big space after \"i.e.\" (in the Equational Reasoning\" paragraph) probably from a missing backslash after the period.</p>\n<p>p. 50.  Should \"in the table below\" be changed to \"in Table 3\" (especially since Table 2 is also below, currently?)</p>\n<p>p. 56.  In question (2), the phrase \"no finite models\" should probably be \"no nontrivial finite models\"</p>\n<p>Also, I'd be a bit surprised if question (4) is open.</p>\n<p>p. 57.

Actually, we have the stronger property that E2⊨E13 is next-to-irreducible in the sense that any law E with E2⊨E⊨E13 must be equivalent to E2, E5, or E13.  Indeed, E13 states that x◇y=S(y) with S(S(y))=y.  Evaluating both sides of E using these identities gives one of x=y, x=S(y), x=x, or x=S(x), in which cases E is equivalent to E2, E2, E13, and E5, respectively.  Of course the same properties hold with E13 replaced by E62 (stating that x◇y=S(y) with S a bijection of order 3) or similar equations involving S of prime order.  And there are whole families of implications that are next-to-next-to-irreducible, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>",

Hence I want to collect your opinion, before keeping on and (hopefully not) finding in the end that you completely dislike the result. Take into account that quite a bit of our hints, tips, and evidence would appear in what remains (as can be seen by looking at the draft).</p>\n<p>I attach here the section file (I think it should be a section now, not a subsection), so that you can read it (up to section 1.2.3 at the end of page 12) and decide: Do you like it as it is/would be when finished? Do you want to crop it significantly and you know how?

Given that we can still keep working on the paper even after it is arXiv'ed (and have a delay between arXiv'ing and submitting), we can focus on splicing in a condensed version of the section along the above lines that is presentable (no glaring errors in grammar or missing material etc.) but polish it a bit more later.

Sometimes paperwork goes out to everyone to positively assent and people get chased down on holidays, etc.  In our group that won't work, not least of which is that some of us answer to no one. <span aria-label=\"sunglasses\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60e\" role=\"img\" title=\"sunglasses\">:sunglasses:</span>   The conventions are more sophisticated than you might assume, though, everyone knows that different people did different parts and coauthor G isn't held responsible for mistakes in team R's section.</p>\n<p>In our case, everything is public, and every named author (along with everyone else on the planet!) has had an opportunity to follow the development of the paper at whatever frequency they liked.  The action of contributing your name to the paper (assuming we added no one without direction) given our public Zulip+github setup is a presumptive consent that you're okay with the expected forward movement of the process, given that at any moment you have the opportunity to opt out.</p>\n<p>I do think we should arrange a more formal signoff before submission to a journal proper, given that our submitting author is on the hook for the agreement, but I'd be okay with @-ing all submitters ASAP giving them a veto period for now.  We then require one final positive assent from everyone before journal submission, which we can start as early as possible (maybe following Shreyas' thread idea) to give us the largest window to connect with our less online members.</p>",

This time by Codex:</p>\n<h1>Review Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scope of formalization wording (paper/intro.tex:5–47 vs paper/foundations.tex:84; paper/data.tex:3)</strong> — Intro/outcomes still say all 22,028,942 implications are “formalized in Lean,” while Foundations and the Data section say only a generating set is formalized and the rest are filled by external programs. In the repo the closure is now computed inside Lean (as a computation, not one theorem per edge) via <code>equational_theories/Closure.lean</code> and <code>scripts/extract_implications.lean</code>. Please harmonize: e.g. “we formalize 10,657 positive and 586,925 negative generators in Lean, and compute the full closure by a Lean program (not external tooling)” or, if some edges remain non-Lean, spell out exactly what is formally verified and what is not.</li>\n<li><strong>Finite-equivalence argument too terse (paper/constructions.tex:117–118)</strong> — The remark that Eq 206 and Eq 1648 are equivalent for finite magmas is sketched in one direction and the reverse is “similar.” Because this justifies why the constructions must be infinitary, please either give the full finite-magma proof in both directions or point to the exact Lean/blueprint lemma establishing the equivalence.</li>\n<li><strong>Linear model claim needs correction (paper/spectrum.tex:12–18)</strong> — Stating that the linear operation \\((a,b)=(1,1)\\) “cannot satisfy a law for all \\(n\\)” is false: addition mod \\(n\\) satisfies associativity/commutativity uniformly. Please clarify the intended restriction (e.g., “(1,1) only gives the already-covered commutative/group consequences and yields no new full-spectrum witnesses”) or otherwise correct the claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Counterexamples not cited (paper/metatheorems.tex:204–207)</strong> — The proof sketch of Proposition \\ref{854-3316} rejects cases (i) and (iii) by appealing to counterexamples to \\(\\Eq{854}\\models\\Eq{4}\\) and \\(\\Eq{854}\\models\\Eq{10}\\) but provides no model or pointer. Please cite the Lean statements already present: <code>equational_theories/ManuallyProved/Equation854.lean:41</code> (<code>not_l4</code>) refutes \\(\\Eq{854}\\models\\Eq{4}\\) and <code>equational_theories/ManuallyProved/Equation854.lean:47</code> (<code>not_l10</code>) refutes \\(\\Eq{854}\\models\\Eq{10}\\); both are derived from explicit finite models (<code>All4x4Tables</code> / <code>FinitePoly</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Ambiguous “constant law” naming (paper/numbering.tex:61–63)</strong> — Both \\(\\Eq{41}\\) and \\(\\Eq{46}\\) are labeled “constant law” though they differ (\\(x\\op x\\) vs \\(x\\op y\\)). To avoid later ambiguity when referring to “the constant law,” please either disambiguate the labels (e.g., “diagonal constant” vs “binary constant”) or add a note that both names refer to equivalent laws.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not sure any of this is worth investigating/addressing before uploading the preprint.

But I thought that the main text was correct when saying only a generating set is formalized and we don't actually have an end-to-end theorem; did that change?  I believe <code>scripts/extract_implications.lean</code> is about packaging data for the Equation Explorer and similar non-Lean tools.</p>\n<p>The second point should be ignored: the proof E1648⊨(finite)E206 really is very similar to E206⊨(finite)E1648.  We don't point to the specific blueprint lemma for all proofs in the paper.</p>\n<p>The third point is a mistake on my part when writing the spectrum section; what happens is that (a,b)=(1,1) can only obey laws whose order on both sides is positive (and of course the empty law 1), which are already covered by (a,b)=(0,0).  I'm too tired to find a good short replacement sentence.</p>\n<p>For the fourth point (on not(E854⊨E4) and not(E854⊨E10)) we could mention that the E854⊨E4 counterexample is a magma of size 2 and the E854⊨E10 counterexample is a magma of size 11 (minimal, I just checked, and there are many such magmas).</p>\n<p>For the fifth point about constant laws, come on, this is abusive pedantry, the laws are equivalent.</p>",
