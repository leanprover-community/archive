(One can of course still pursue additional spinoff projects, as we have already been doing for instance with the finite magmas spinoff, or make technical improvements to the codebase; but in my mind the \"official\" part of the project will wrap up once the paper is written, submitted, revised, accepted and published.)</p>\n<p>We already have several issues claimed <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/873\">equational#873</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/922\">equational#922</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/926\">equational#926</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/956\">equational#956</a> to contribute chapters or subsections to the draft that are still outstanding.  Perhaps this thread can be used for the contributors who had claimed these sections to report on their status.</p>\n<p>One of the writing issues, <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/924\">equational#924</a> (writing a section reporting on the finite magma implication spinoff project), remains unclaimed (a stub exists in the draft at Section 8).  A volunteer to claim this section also would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>I plan to go through the draft later today to update it and identify any further issues to formally make (based on several boldface comments currently in the draft).  A lot of it is in decent shape though, so I think once we have the contributed chapters we can move into the proofreading and polishing stage.  (But if anyone has any suggestions for the global structure of the paper, this thread would be a good place to discuss them.)</p>\n<p>If any contributors wish to register themselves as a participant or co-author of the project but has not yet made a <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/issues?q=label%3Acontribution+\">contributor PR</a> listing your contributions, this would be a good time to do so.  Contributors can also update their contact and contribution details in Appendix B of the paper.</p>\n<p>An obvious journal for this paper, by the way, would be the newly formed <a href=\"https://afm.episciences.org/\">Annals of Formalized Mathematics</a>, but this would also be a good time to discuss any other possible options.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've gone through <a href=\"https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/paper.pdf\">the paper</a> and done some cleanup.  For instance, I've removed the \"statistics\" section as we don't really have much to report here (but instead sprinkled some more stats about the implication graph elsewhere in the paper), and also shortened the \"Author contributions\" section since we are using the <code>contributions.md</code> file as our main source here.  (But we should include contact information and affiliation in the main paper still; if you are listed as an author but have not entered in this information, feel free to submit a PR or else DM me with the required details.)</p>\n<p>The most significant content I added was in the \"conclusions\" section (Section 13), where I proposed some lessons to draw from the project, and some future directions.  This is very much a tentative draft for this section, and I very much welcome more input to weigh in on what lessons to draw from this project.  There may be things that I omitted, or misrepresented, or perhaps are not worth saying, so any feedback would be encouraged here.</p>\n<p>I also wrote something for Section 3 (formal foundations), though I was a little unsure about some of the backend stuff (e.g., how we ended up implementing laws vs equations), so some scrutiny and corrections here would also be welcome.</p>\n<p>One section that is still completely missing is Section 12 (data management), which is something we really haven't talked about.  Presumably the Github repository will be our primary data repository going forward.  The actual data of our project, particularly the implication graph, can be accessed from Equation Explorer, though I don't think we quite have a way of converting an arbitrary edge in the graph to an actual Lean theorem yet.  Is there anything we could do to make the data we have more accessible that doesn't require an enormous amount of additional effort?</p>",
