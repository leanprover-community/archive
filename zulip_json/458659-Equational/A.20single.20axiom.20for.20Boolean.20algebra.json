Let me write magmas on {0,1} in terms of their multiplication table, so 0011 denotes the left projection magma.

Those of 0011 and 0101 are given by the left/right projection laws <code>x=x◇y</code> and <code>x=y◇x</code> respectively.

It is <em>n</em>-based if it can be axiomatized by <em>n</em> equations, that is, there are <em>n</em> equations in the equational theory from which one can derive all the equational theory using Birkhoff's rules for equational logic. (One could also use first-order logic.)</p>\n<p>I never thought of being <em>n</em>-based as implying that one cannot have fewer equations in a base. At the end of the 1973 paper by P&amp;Q one finds the statement \"there are finitely based equational theories ... which are <em>n</em>-based but not <em>n</em> — 1  based\" indicating that for them being <em>n</em>-based did not imply there was no smaller base. The terminology in universal algebra was largely developed after WWII, and is still being developed and stabilized. For example, I first heard the word <em>idemprimal</em> in the last few months.  Perhaps that is because I have not followed the terminology so closely since my retirement in the mid 1990s. I will forward your comments/questions to a few universal algebra colleagues for further insights.</p>\n<p>One notion of a minimal equational base is one that is irredundant.<br>\nAn equational base is <em>irredundant</em> if it fails to be a base after removing any equation. Tarski proved a beautiful result (see p. 33 of the B&amp;S book) that implies the sizes of the finite irredundant bases of an equational theory of magmas is a convex set of integers.</p>\n<p>I have nothing to add to your analysis of minimal sized bases for 2-element magmas except some additional terminology. Since the  two element Boolean algebra is primal, any finitary function on {0,1} can be expressed by a term in Boolean algebra. The minimum operation is xy, the max x+y, generating the varieties of meet-semilattices and of join-semilattices.  The operation 0110 is the symmetric difference xy' + x'y. The last four in your list are interesting but not familiar---the operation 0100 is simply x'y.</p>\n<p>I have no idea of how to determine if a randomly chosen finite magma has a 1-based equational theory. Once we move away from traditional areas of algebra like groups, rings, lattices, and more recent areas like congruence distributive varieties, like varieties generated by quasiprimals, one has left the civilized world and entered the jungle. For example I have little hope of being able to determine the spectrum of a variety generated by a randomly chosen magma.</p>\n<p>I don't know how rapidly the density of quasiprimals among <em>n</em>-element  magmas converges to 100% although one could effectively find a value of <em>n</em> for which it is greater than say 50% by looking at the estimates in the 10 cases in Murskii's proof (stated in Aichinger's Masters Thesis). I suspect the density is monotone increasing, but that is only a guess. We have the counts for 2-element and 3-element magmas, but not even 4-element magmas.</p>",

There is likely a shorter proof than the following:</p>\n<p>Proof: <strong>A</strong> generates the same variety as the 3-element magma <strong>B</strong> = ({0,1,2}, ◇) with table [0,0,0,1,0,1,2,2,0] since <strong>B</strong> is isomorphic to a subalgebra of <strong>A</strong>^2 and <strong>A</strong> is a subalgebra of <strong>B</strong>. From the B&amp;B catalog for 3-element groupoids we know that the variety V(<strong>B</strong>) is congruence distributive (<strong>B</strong> is B&amp;B <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/239\">#239</a>). By a result of  Jonsson (see B&amp;S p. 149, Corollary 6.10) all subdirectly irreducible members of V(<strong>A</strong>) are in HS(<strong>A</strong>). QED</p>\n<p>Showing that the associative law for  AND, which is of order 10 when expressed in terms of ◇, follows from 1043 and 4293 would be an encouraging step towards proving one has a 2-base for the equational theory of the 2-element [0,0,1,0] magma.</p>\n<p>To prove that 1043 and 4293 form a 2-base for V(<strong>A</strong>) indeed it suffices to show that <strong>A</strong> is the only subdirectly irreducible model of the two equations. One could try to emulate results of Stone for Boolean algebras and Birkhoff for distributive lattices to show that for any model <strong>M</strong> of the two equations and distinct elements a, b in <strong>M</strong>, a maximal congruence separating the two elements must have only two cosets. They were able to define a partial order a \\le b  by a \\meet b = a. This carries over to V(<strong>A</strong>). For Boolean algebra one had the fact that a congruence is determined by the coset of 0, an ideal. From the consequence x◇x = y◇y of 1043 and 4293 one has a least element, and perhaps a congruence on <strong>M</strong> is also determined by the coset of this element.</p>",

The lowest-order choice for the first equations is idempotence <code>x=x◇x</code>, then the possibilities of order up to 4 for the second law are the shift-associative laws: law 4364 <code>x◇(y◇z) = y◇(z◇x)</code> or its dual law 4679 <code>(x◇y)◇z=(y◇z)◇x</code>, or law 4541 <code>x◇(y◇z) = (z◇x)◇y</code>.</p>\n<p>It turns out that <code>x=x◇(x◇x)</code> and <code>(x◇y)◇z = (y◇z)◇(x◇x)</code> form another 2-basis, so we don't necessarily have to include idempotence.

        "content": "<p>Let me return to the 0010 magma later, but for now let's review some basic facts from universal algebra, stated for magmas but they apply for algebras in general, and apply them to V(0001).</p>\n<p>Let E be a collection of magma equations, and e such an equation. Let's say \"e is a consequence of E\" if either of the following two equivalent conditions hold:</p>\n<p>1) (semantic consequence) Every magma satisfying E also satisfies e.</p>\n<p>2) (syntactic consequence) There is a formal derivation of e from E (say using Birkhoff's rules for equational logic).</p>\n<p>Their equivalence is Birkhoff's completeness theorem. There are cases where 1) is easier to apply, and cases where 2) is a better choice.</p>\n<p>Understanding the variety V(M) generated by a magma M has two basic components:</p>\n<p>a) Describing the magmas in V(M)</p>\n<p>b) Finding a set of equations (a base) for the equational theory of V(M), which is the same as the equational theory of M.</p>\n<p>(The same setup applies to a variety V(K) generated by a class K of magmas.)</p>\n<p>For (a) we know from Tarski that V(M) consists of all homomorphic images of subalgebras of powers of M (this is the HSP theorem). To get something more \"concrete\" Birkhoff showed that every magma is a subdirect product of subdirectly irreducible magmas, the subdirectly irreducibles being homomorphic images of the magma. Getting ones hands on the subdirectly irreducible members of V(M) may be difficult, but in some cases we can. If  M is finite and V(M) is congruence distributive, that is every magma in V(M) has a distributive lattice of congruences, Jónsson showed that every subdirectly irreducible in V(M) is a homomorphic image of a subalgebra of M. For M small and finite this makes finding the subdirectly irreducibles rather easy. In particular if M has 2 elements then it is the only subdirectly irreducible in V(M).</p>\n<p>But V(0001) is not congruence distributive, so we resort to a direct semantic argument just for it to determine the subdirectly irreducible members. 0001, being a 2-element magma, is subdirectly irreducible. One goal is to show there are no other non-trivial subdirectly irreducibles in V(0001). We do know that every member of V(0001) satisfies the idempotent, commutative and associative equations since 0001 does.  We will show that each magma satisfying these 3 equations is in V(0001), so they form a 3-base for V(0001).</p>\n<p>On each magma M satisfying these 3 equations define a binary relation \\le by a \\le b iff  a = a ◇ b. Using these 3 equations one can prove that \\le is a partial order on the elements of M. </p>\n<p>For distinct a,b in M with a not-\\le b define an equivalence relation R on M by <br>\nxRy iff (a \\le x and a \\le y)   or  (a not-\\le x and a not-\\le y).<br>\nThen a and b are not R-equivalent. <br>\nAlso there are exactly two equivalence classes, namely {x : a \\le x} and {x : a not-\\le x}. From the three equations we know M satisfies one can prove that R is a congruence on M, that is, xRy and uRv imply xuRyv.<br>\nThe quotient magma M/R is isomorphic to 0001, and a/R \\neq b/R.<br>\nThis means M can be embedded in the product of all such M/R, that is,<br>\nin a power of 0001.<br>\nThus we finally have a structure theorem for V(0001), namely all members are subdirect powers of 0001, and vice-versa. This was achieved with only knowing the 3 equations above held in V(0001), and every model of them is in V(0001). So they must not only be true of V(0001), they must axiomatize it, i.e., be a base for its equational theory.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks a lot for the explanation!  That also clarifies some details of your proof above that V(0010) has a unique subdirectly irreducible magma.  However, I notive that the proofs via the B&amp;B catalog and congruence distributivity are useful mostly to orient us, but do not seem load-bearing in the final arguments.  Indeed, to prove that some equations E are a basis of the equational theory for V(A), what we really care about is to determine subdirectly irreducible magmas satisfying E, and specifically show they belong to V(A).</p>\n<p>For A=0001 and E=[idempotence, commutativity, associativity] that's what you did: for any magma M obeying E, and distinct elements a,b∈M, either a≰b or b≰a, and you built a morphism to A that distinguishes these two elements.  But a subdirectly irreducible M would have a pair of elements a,b that could not be distinguished by any homomorphic image not isomorphic to M.  So the only possible subdirectly irreducible one is M=A.  (Alternatively, taking for instance the product over all pairs (a,b), we inject M into a power of A.)</p>\n<p>For A=0010 and E=[1043,4293], I built similarly a morphism to a Boolean algebra equipped with <code>x◇y = x∧¬y</code>.  This shows that subdirectly irreducible magmas M obeying E are such Boolean algebras that are subdirectly irreducible as Boolean algebras.  With (a weak form of) the axiom of choice we have the Stone representation theorem that realizes the algebra as the set of clopen sets of some topological space, and in particular as a subalgebra of the power set of that space, which is simply a power of A.</p>\n<p>Without the axiom of choice, a <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/a/64232/36972\">mathoverflow answer by François G. Dorais</a> points out that <a href=\"http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=143705\">H. Läuchli MR143705</a> built a model with an infinite-dimensional vector space whose proper subspaces are finite-dimensional.  If this still works over the fields F2, then we may get a Boolean algebra whose quotients are all isomorphic to itself.  Details are very unclear to me.

        "content": "<p>Now that it seems that the equational theory of V(0001) is indeed 2-based but not 1-based,  I want to return to looking at V(0010), which is the same as V(B&amp;B <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/239\">#239</a>) .</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler-block\"><div class=\"spoiler-header\">\n<p>SOME BACKGROUND</p>\n</div><div class=\"spoiler-content\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<p>First some clarification. When Joel and I made the B&amp;B catalog back in the 1990s the goal was to show how computers could be useful to assist in proving theorems in universal algebra about finitely generated varieties V(A) regarding popular topics like congruence distributivity (CD), congruence permutability (CP), congruence modularity (CM), quasiprimality, etc.</p>\n<p>A word about why CD was much in fashion. <br>\n(1) Every finitely generated CD variety is finitely based. (Baker)<br>\n(2) For A finite and V(A) CD, the subdirectly irreducibles in V(A) are in HS(A). (Jónsson)</p>\n<p>Example regarding (2): Given two finite magmas A and B, a simple question was how to determine if V(A) is a subclass of V(B), i.e., does A belong to V(B). If V(A) and V(B) were CD then by Jónsson's result one could sort through the finitely many quotients of subalgebras of A to find all the subdirectly irreducibles in V(A), and likewise for V(B). Then V(A) is a subclass of V(B) iff the first set of subdirectly irreducibles is a subset of the second set. With great enthusiasm this was actually used to determine portions of  the lattice of varieties of lattices since every variety of lattices is CD.</p>\n<p>To impress our colleagues we decided to computer analyze properties of A and V(A) for the thousands (3^9) of 3-element magmas. Using the same algorithms we separately wrote C-programs for the entire catalog to hopefully guarantee the accuracy of the results. The results were well received by colleagues, few of whom were proficient in computer programming at the time.</p>\n<p>It never occurred to us to make a catalog for the sixteen 2-element magmas, so recently when considering V(0010) my first query was to see if there was a 3-element magma generating this variety so I could use the B&amp;B catalog. To my surprise there was (B&amp;B # 239) , and thus I learned that V(0010) is CD but not CP.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>The computer proof that V = V(B&amp;B <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/239\">#239</a>) is CD used a brute force search algorithm to find two ternary Jónsson terms (Theorem 12.6, B&amp;S, page 80) </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code> p_1(x,y,z) is  x◇((x◇y)◇z)        p_2(x,y,z) is  z◇(y◇x)\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>such that V satisfies</p>\n<p>x = p_1(x,x,y)<br>\np_1(x,y,y) = p_2(x,y,y)<br>\np_2(x,x,y) = y,</p>\n<p>that is, it satisfies</p>\n<p>x = x◇((x◇x)◇y)<br>\nx◇((x◇y)◇y)  = y◇(y◇x)<br>\ny◇(x◇x) = y.   </p>\n<p>These equations hold in V(0010). Then P&amp;Q (1973) Theorem 1, page 375 says this guarantees the variety is 3-based. Presumably one can effectively find the basis from the Jónsson terms...I need to study this paper to see what is going on!</p>",

However to prove that every Boolean algebra satisfies all the identities of the two-element BA it seems one needs Zorn's Lemma to show every algebra is a subdirect product of subdirectly irreducibles (B&amp;S page 58, Thm 8.6).</p>\n<p>To prove that this variety is not 1-based (if  true) I suspect that, much as with semilattices, one would need a property P that holds for both sides of every elementary deduction from the two axioms whenever one side has P, but holds only for one side for a suitably narrowed list of possible candidates for a single axiom. As with semilattices, one side of a single axiom would have to be a variable.</p>",

Zoltan's proof circumvents all that by showing that once we have a Boolean algebra we are done.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the proof indeed there are a lot of ATP-derived steps.  I could try to collect the various ATP inputs for reference, or to convert them into a Lean proof, but it would be best to determine what we plan to do with these results, to avoid wasting efforts on formalization.

If a Boolean algebra B can be written as a product of two non-trivial BAs, say B \\isom B_1 x B_2, then the kernels of the projection maps are non-trivial congruences of the product, but their intersection is the trivial congruence. This means B does not have a smallest non-trivial congruence, and hence cannot be subdirectly irreducible (B&amp;S page 57, Theorem 8.4).<br>\nThus subdirectly irreducible implies directly indecomposable.</p>\n<p>Perhaps a word on the Wikipedia definition is needed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra\">universal algebra</a> <em>A</em> is said to be subdirectly irreducible when <em>A</em> has more than one element, and when any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdirect_product\">subdirect representation</a> of <em>A</em> includes (as a factor) an algebra <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic\">isomorphic</a> to <em>A</em>, with the isomorphism being given by the projection map.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The phrase \"any subdirect representation\" needs to be read as \"every subdirect representation\", not \"some subdirect representation\".</p>\n<p>Regarding how much detail needs to be written up regarding the proof that the variety V(0010) is axiomatized by equations 1043 and 4293 goes to the core of the dilemma mathematicians face when there are powerful ATPs. Short of Lean verification, how much weight is to be given to announcements of new results obtained only with the help of computers, especially ATPs? And how much credit to the author when it comes to climbing the academic ladder? If you leave your work on V(0010) as it is, will your 2-basis be regarded simply as a \"claim\", or a \"likely theorem\"? I don't know the answer to these questions.</p>",
