        "content": "<p>The involution sending a magma to its opposite magma maps some equations to others (for example it fixes equations 1 to 3, and interchanges <code>Equation4</code> and <code>Equation5</code>). Equation 8 is the first to not have a twin, which would be <code>x =  (x ∘ x) ∘ x</code>. Similarly <code>Equation42</code> seems to have no twin. This means that a symmetry in the picture is obscured (you can recover it by throwing away nodes whose dual is not a node). Adding dual equations means more work, but many proofs can be duplicated (because they are just an op of an existing proof). Note that <code>Equation168</code> is self-dual. I guess for the associativity choices at the end you could weaken the variables in any order giving four more equations. Weakening <code>y</code> first (<code>x ∘ (a ∘ z) = (x ∘ b) ∘ z</code>) is self-dual and what might be a genuinely new thing. Weakening <code>z</code> is the dual of weakening <code>x</code>.</p>",
