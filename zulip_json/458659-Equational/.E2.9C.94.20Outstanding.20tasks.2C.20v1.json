A way to automatically generate outstanding unsolved implications between existing equations, with a focus on the ones that are the least \"redundant\", or most \"pivotal\" in some sense.</li>\n<li>D3.  A way to automatically generate one or more visualizations of the progress thus far.</li>\n<li>D4.  Some API for Magma relations, allowing one to start proving metatheorems about relations (e.g., formalizing the observation that any relation of the form <code>x = f(y,z,u)</code> is equivalent to <code>x=y</code>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will update this list as contributions come in.  (For instance, if one of the \"C\" tasks is resolved, this will then create a number of \"A\" or \"B\" tasks.)

Eventually we may split up the current Basic.lean file into many other files, some of which may be quite static and presumably can be precompiled.  If you have achieved some automated way to generate some easy implications then that can certainly be added to the project (possibly under a different file, if you are worried about overwhelming the Basic.lean file) and we can figure out how best to integrate things later.</p>",

An interesting thing about having so many implications, is I was able to look for cycles in the graph (e.g. equivalent formulas), and found some, though not so many yet.
