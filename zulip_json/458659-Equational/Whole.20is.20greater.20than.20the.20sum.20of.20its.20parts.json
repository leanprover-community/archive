This was for instance proposed by Pace Nielsen in <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/#comment-685891\">this blog comment</a>, and I think elsewhere as well. This will be harder for several reasons, most notably because 3-SAT is way harder than 2-SAT, but the relations we obtain in this project will help reduce the problem significantly.  As Pace suggests, we may have to cut down to just three operations instead of four to obtain a feasible project.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there any equations X, Y, Z such that X does not imply Z, and Y does not imply Z, but 'X and Y' implies Z? I fully expect the answer to be yes, so what I'm really asking is for examples to play with (maybe from the subgraph equations).</p>",

Apply the Yoneda Lemma to get a contravariant embedding functor Y: L -&gt; P(L), where Y(A) = set of consequences of A. If the Yoneda embedding is continuous (i.e. it preserves limits, i.e. it preserves meets), then Y('A and B') = Y(A) \\cup Y(B) (as the functor is contravariant, limits get sent to colimits) and thus we can determine 'A and B' from A and B.  Thus the problem only arises when continuity fails, i.e., when there are equations (doesn't have to be two equations but for the sake of simplicity:) A and B such that Y(A) \\cup Y(B) != Y('A and B'), and this is what I call a 'generative effect'. Note that it is always the case that Y(A)\\cup Y(B) \\subseteq Y('A and B').</p>",
