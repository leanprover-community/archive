        "content": "<p>Since there's a couple of \"special\" equations added in the database, I would like to suggest adding the left/right Bol loop axioms, and the Moufang loop axiom(s), as well. These are two equations that have been studied a good deal, but usually in the context of loops, i.e. cancellative magmas with the identity. In that context, several relationships with other (short) equations are known, like Moufang loops being alternative. It is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moufang_loop#Moufang_quasigroups\">known</a> that the Moufang axiom together with cancellativity implies the existence of an identity.</p>\n<p>But I don't know if anything much is known about these equations in isolation. I've started a draft pr at <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/785\">equational#785</a>, but I also don't know how to get the correct equation numbers. Could someone maybe run one of the automated tools to try to find easy examples / counterexamples? I'm hoping that they can just be placed in the graph without much extra work. :)</p>",
