The 1692 facts appear to be proven in <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/ManuallyProved/Equation1692.lean\"><code>Equation1692.lean</code></a>.  Does that suggest a missing automated check in the tooling?  (The 1729 fact was the last implication that was formalized and I didn't check if the relevant pull requests have finished their lifecycle.)</p>",
