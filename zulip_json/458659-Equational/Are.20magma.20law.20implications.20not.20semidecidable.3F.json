Deciding whether a law L holds over a <em>finite</em> magma M is decidable by enumeration, and hence deciding whether an implication L1 -&gt; L2 holds over <em>finite</em> magmas is semidecidable because enumerating all finite magmas is guaranteed to yield a counterexample to L1 -&gt; L2 when one exists.</p>\n<p>My question is: is L1 -&gt; L2 semidecidable in general? My intuition is that the answer is negative, and that it is just plain undecidable, because this project has seen pairs of laws crop up that are equivalent over finite magmas but not over arbitrary magmas. But this does not amount to a proof that magma law implications fail to be semidecidable, and I'm wondering if anyone knows of a reference (or a simple argument I'm missing) that proves/disproves this.</p>",
