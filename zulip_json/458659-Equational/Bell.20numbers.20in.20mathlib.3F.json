Catalan numbers exist under <code>Mathlib.Combinatorics.Enumerative</code>, and there is <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Partition/Finpartition.html\">Finpartition</a> for the kind of partitions that Bell numbers count. Searching for Bell in the API doesn't find anything.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know if the definition exists? Otherwise it seems like we should separate their definition to a different issue, if only for task complexity considerations.</p>",
