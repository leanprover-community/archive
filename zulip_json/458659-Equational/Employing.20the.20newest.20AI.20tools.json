If the implication is true, perhaps some combination of other proofs we already have, or very similar, can do the trick, and the AI can find it. If the implication is false, perhaps the AI finds some unexpected relationship between models of different laws to make the right model, or can read our paper and blueprint and find the right model with our techniques, etc.</p>",
