(Note: each of those lists has some equations the others don't.)</p>\n<p>Given that these equations had some special extra interest, I had hoped that they would also be put into the graph of equations. Some are \"known\" to be hard like 5093, but I'm optimistic that most could be rapidly dispatched and placed snugly in the graph. I know that all this tooling exists to find non-/implications ... but I've had trouble running almost any of it myself.</p>\n<p>Would someone, maybe, be so kind as to try running vampire or a countermodel search to try to knock some out? :) Some are already in the repo, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/aaf3b9b312c3c8b6a9de1559cec16ca7717e89ab/equational_theories/Generated/InvariantMetatheoremNonimplications/instLiftingMagmaFamilyFinset_counterexamples.lean#L10\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I guess it would also be very cool if they could be added to the equation explorer, but I understand if people don't want the scope creep there.</p>",

A way to deal with that would be to give the Equation Explorer a dictionary <code>{26302:\"NaturalCentralGroupoid\", 19812:\"NaturalCentralGroupoid\", ..., 42323216: \"HigmanNeumann\", ...}</code> and  some files <code>HigmanNeumann.md</code>, <code>NaturalCentralGroupoid.md</code> that would be shown for many different high-order equations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, maybe the equation explorer could document somewhere why some equations are boldfaced (they contain commentary).</p>\n<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I don't plan to touch the equation explorer myself as I don't know enough javascript and web dev in general.</p>",
