The linear-magmas product, xy=ax+by, is not able to prove that Astérix does not imply Obélix, because the left product map for this product is injective (when b\\neq 0). The idea is then to get more \"combinatorial space\" while maintaining linearity, by introducing conjugated variables and studying the *-linear products<br>\nxy := ax + by + cx^* + dy^*, which are non-injective when either d=b or d=-b (b=d=0 is a degenerate case).<br>\nIn spite of these products giving more parameters to play with, I have shown (by solving the resulting system of *-equations) that no complex *-linear magma is Astérix but not Obélix. For me this has been a bit surprising, does anyone see any easy reason why this may happen? </p>\n<p>I have also tried to find a complex non-injective *-linear product for Equation 63, but again there are none. (Btw, I propose the names Dupont and Dupond, after Tintin's characters, for Equations 63 and 1692, if you like the names!) .</p>\n<p>Anyway, perhaps this approach can work for other yet unknown pairs of identities? We can also try with other (noncommutative) rings with involution.</p>\n<p>If anyone wants to see the proof, I have it in .tex and can upload it anywhere. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

Notice that, over (noncommutative) domains, we can just dismiss affine products without even applying the Astérix equation, just by imposing non-injectivity (since ax+by+c = ax+by' + c implies b(y-y')=0), but there are *-linear products which are non-injective over integral domains with involution (but no Astérix ones!).</p>",

But in order to realize conjugation (i.e., swap the diagonal elements) it is not enough to multiply (only) on the left by some matrix, we need to apply the inner automorphism given by J:=[0,1;1,0], so the *-linear product translates to <br>\naX+bY+cJXJ + dJYJ,<br>\nwhere a,b,c,d are diagonal matrices representing elements of the original ring and X,Y can be general 2x2 matrices if we want. Hence we cannot factor out at the left to get something of the form <br>\nAX+BY<br>\nwith A,B some 2x2 matrices, which is what we need in order to apply the linear result in the matrix ring.</p>",

However, if a law holds for the vector model, it also holds for the matrix model, and vice versa, so for the purposes of determining implications between laws, the situation is equivalent to the matrix law.</p>\n<p>Let's take a concrete example: the law <code>z ◇ (z ◇ w) = w ◇ z</code> with the magma <code>z ◇ w = az + bw + cz^* + dw^*</code>.  Writing <code>Z = vec(z,z^*)</code> and <code>W = vec(w,w^*)</code>, and also <code>A = diag(a,a^*)</code>, etc., the operation in these new coordinates is <code>Z ◇ W = AZ + BW + CJZ + DJW</code> (note we are performing both matrix x matrix multiplication here and matrix x vector multiplication, but they associate with each other so I dispense with parentheses).  The law in question then becomes</p>\n<p><code>AZ + B(AZ+BW+CJZ+DJW) + CJZ + DJ(AZ+BW+CJZ+DJW) = AW+BZ+CJW+DJZ</code></p>\n<p>This has to hold for all <code>Z, W</code>, in a space that generates all of C^2 as a C-vector space, so we can equate coefficients and conclude that</p>\n<p><code>A + BA + BCJ + CJ + DJA + CJ = B + DJ; BB + BDJ + DJB + DJ = A + CJ.</code> (*)</p>\n<p>Now, let us switch to a new magma, the magma of 2 x 2 complex matrices with law <code>M ◇ N = AM + BN + CJM + DJN</code>.  This is a law with exactly the same algebraic behavior as the previous Wirtinger magma, so if the above matrix identity (*) holds, then this new matrix magma will also obey the same law <code>M ◇ (M ◇ N) = N ◇ M</code> as the Wirtinger magma.</p>\n<p>But this new magma is an example of a noncommutative linear magma <code>M ◇ N = a M + b N</code> in a noncommutative ring, in this case the ring of 2 x 2 complex matrices, with <code>a = A + CJ</code> and <code>b = B + DJ</code>.
