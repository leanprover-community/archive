Unfortunately I could not attend in person and am giving the talk virtually (which was somewhat inconvenient due to time zones).  I have uploaded the slides <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/math-experiments.pdf\">here</a>, am happy to receive any feedback.</p>\n<p>I am currently overextended on several other obligations, but I do plan to get back to the paper writing tasks to wrap up the primary portion of the project at some point in the near future.</p>",
