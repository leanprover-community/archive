There is a plethora of possible tools, and I just wondered whether alg (<a href=\"https://github.com/andrejbauer/alg\">https://github.com/andrejbauer/alg</a>) could be of any use. It's a program specialized to enumerate finite first-order theories, and specialized for the algebraic theories. I suspect by now you have tools that outperform alg?</p>",
