Personally, although I've spent many CPU hours doing informal benchmarking of Prover9/Mace4, I would feel uneasy if the subject is slippery for us, since ATPs and software testing are complicated... Unless Daniel Weber (or someone else less participative until now) declares him/herself an expert an can guide this part of the project, the result would be less than optimal and detract from the rest of the paper.</p>\n<p>That being said, I still think <em>there is</em> something we can contribute: instead of focusing on what we can contribute to expert ATP researchers, we can center on what we can contribute to <em>novice ATP users</em>, algebra (or perhaps general) researchers who, as some of us at the start of this project, want to use ATPs for the first time on problems that need them, and may be at a loss of what to use, what parameters may be important... in summary, what may make a difference. Here we can be more informal, throw a couple of \"benchmarking\" tables for the same ATP with different parameters and for different ATPs, talk about some relative gains in time (changing parameters we saw a 500 times speedup on this particular problem), etc. This is knowledge I think we have gained to some extent, and certainly I would have been glad to receive this kind of hints before we started!</p>",
