As before, the equations are grouped by equivalence class.</p>\n<p>Probably no revolutionary new patterns to gleam from this, but I find the picture nice to look at. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/7nlOJuE23AmV78XDi0Mdf5w5/outcomes.png\">outcomes.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/7nlOJuE23AmV78XDi0Mdf5w5/outcomes.png\" title=\"outcomes.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"4694x4694\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/7nlOJuE23AmV78XDi0Mdf5w5/outcomes.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",

Since it is sorted towards the bottom it means it's a relatively strong law, with lots of implications. Still, there's only 6 equations in the equivalence class, which breaks with the pattern of other strong laws, which seem to amass big equivalence classes. I'm guessing this is also just an artifact of the limitation of the project to a maximum of 4 operations per equation, but it still caught my eye.</p>",
