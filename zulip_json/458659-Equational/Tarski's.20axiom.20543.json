It's interesting that our project just sort of silently completed the analysis for this equation without flagging anything special about it!   It does imply a reasonably large number (162) of other identities (as one would expect from a law codifying abelian groups), though it is far from the record-holder in this regard.  I wonder if it has any other anomalous features that could have been picked up from our analysis; who knows what else we are missing out there in our graph!</p>",

I understand why we don't, of course, the subtraction operation <em>isn't</em> commutative or associative, but I think this kind of fact (\"this is an Abelian group!\") is by some standards much more exciting! So I spent a while trying to think about how to formally extend this to a problem we could check off as yes/no.</p>\n<p>I want to be able to say something like, \"If a Magma M has operation * obeying equation A,  then it has a _compatible_ operation obeying equation B.\" -- or, that it doesn't. This is absolutely the kind of language I would use about talking a particular equation pair, like 543&lt;--&gt;Associative. But \"compatible\" is a bit of a weasel word here, which would conventionally be defined in a way that explicitly relates the two operations. Since a magma doesn't otherwise have any structure, I could <em>always</em> just put <em>some</em> group structure on it and claim that the resulting operation is 'compatible', so that's not useful on its own.</p>\n<p>I think the right notion here is relative first order definability. I would say that operations A and B are compatible if there's a first order formula to define each from the other with a first order formula. In this case with operations \"-\" and \"+\", that would be <code>Forall x, y, z: x+y = z \\iff x=z-y</code>. Or, maybe alternatively, <code>x+y := ExistsUnique z, x=z-y</code> to be a bit more 'constructive'. There could then be a graph of which types of operations let us define other compatible operations. It would also form a DAG. I think this would be a great extension of the project.</p>",

And then there's the distinction between FO-definable and term-definable (resp FO/term-structural). Where term-definable captures the notion of having an expression to spell it out.</p>\n<p>Under this definition, the associative law (and commutative law) is structural for Equation 543: given the group operation <code>x+y</code> I can recover the 543-operation with the FO formula <code>(-).graph = {(x,y,z) | x = y+z}</code>. The associative law is also term-definable: I can define it as <code>x+y := x-((x-x)-y)</code>, which is just a term. But it does <em>not</em> appear to be term-structural, as I currently have it defined, because there's no way to recover <code>-</code> from <code>+</code> with just a term. You would need the inverse operation. So <code>-</code> to <code>+</code> is a term, and <code>+</code> is structural, but the recovery map <code>+</code> to <code>-</code> can't be written as a term. Of course we could define \"term-structural\" differently without requiring this, but having it be terms both ways seemed most natural. And we can't go the other way. ... Right? </p>\n<p>I've been thinking about it more and there's some more interesting subtleties going on here. When talking about how to define one operation from the other, one first talks about the realization of an operation in a magma, and then definability is always relative to a structure. There's two different ways to do this then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>op1</code> is definable from <code>op2</code> if, in every magma obeying <code>op2</code>, there's a FO formula that defines <code>op1</code>.</li>\n<li><code>op1</code> is definable from <code>op2</code> if there's a FO formula such that, in every magma obeying <code>op2</code>, the formula defines <code>op1</code>.<br>\nThese are a different ordering of quantifiers (existential over formulas, and universal over magmas). They could in principle be different: it could be that an operation could always be recovered from the other by _some_ formula, but that formula is magma-dependent. That seemed kind of strange though and I didn't think it would happen, so I didn't worry about it.</li>\n</ul>",

In any finite magma obeying equation 543, we can recover the <code>-</code> operation from the <code>+</code>, with just a term, without needing an inverse operation. But that term depends on the magma! The <code>+</code> magma is an abelian group, and so (by looking at the order of the group and finding a number <code>k</code> that's congruent to <code>-1</code> modulo all the unitary divisors) we can always write something like <code>x-y = x+(y+y+y+y+y+y...)</code>.</p>\n<p>So equation 543 is \"term-structural\" in this sense for finite magmas, but not for infinite magmas (like integer addition).

So far the main results I've written up are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implication (the main effort of the equational theories project) implies these other four notions, the strongest one being \"term-structural\" and the weakest being \"first-order definable\" (or just, definable).</li>\n<li>Equations are always term-structural in terms of their duals, so duals are equivalence classes.</li>\n<li>Associative and commutative laws are term-definable, and first-order structural, for equation 543 (which is in turn implied by a number of other laws).</li>\n<li>The constant law is term-definable from any law of the form f(x,y) = f(z,w) -- or likewise, with any number of disjoint variables on the left and right hand side. For instance, equation 4336 <code>x ◇ (y ◇ x) = z ◇ (w ◇ z)</code> lets you define a constant law as <code>x * y := x ◇ (y ◇ x)</code>. Since these laws are also implied by the constant law, this leads to a sizable collapse into an equivalence class.</li>\n<li>The commutative law is term-definable from any law of the form f(x,y) = f(y,x). One could state this more generally for any equation of the form e.g. f(x,y,w) = f(y,x,z) or f(x,y,x) = f(y,x,z), but these imply the corresponding equation f(x,y) = f(y,x), so we don't need to explicitly do that. As one example, equation 4321 <code>x ◇ (y ◇ x) = y ◇ (x ◇ y)</code> yields the commutative law as <code>x * y := x ◇ (y ◇ x)</code>.</li>\n<li>I would also like to check Eq42323216 <code>x = y ◇ ((((y ◇ y) ◇ x) ◇ z) ◇ (((y ◇ y) ◇ y) ◇ z))</code> (for non-abelian groups), if it's easily implied by any of our &lt;4-op laws, since that gives an associative law (and a constant law). That would probably be a computer search.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of non-implications, where first-order definability is strongest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obviously if equation A has models of size k and equation B does not, then B is not definable from A.</li>\n<li>First-order defining an equation commutes with automorphisms of the original magma. So if a magma on type M obeying equation A has an automorphism φ : M -&gt; M, but no magma on M obeying equation B obeys that automorphism, then B can't be definable from A.</li>\n<li>If B is structural from A, then they must have isomorphic automorphism groups, and the same number of magmas on any type.<br>\nI haven't actually searched to try to find any examples of these. The first point should be the easiest to check, since I know we have data for the smallest nontrivial models of most (each?) equation. Is that data proved, though, and where can I find it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, I hope to actually compute the transitive closure of those first implications tonight. I'm mostly curious to see how much the equivalence classes already collapse.</p>",

In the second case <code>k+l=0</code>, we have <code>gcd(k,l)=|k|</code> so we need <code>k=-l=±1</code>, so the operation is subtraction (up to swapping arguments).  <strong>Conclusion:</strong> among abelian groups, only subtraction works.</p>",

I just saw that the Higman-Neumann mentions subtraction as being the only operation (in the abelian case) and leaves open the nonabelian case.  It could be interesting to spend a bit of effort in this direction at some point, for instance to see if (x,y)↦x²y⁻¹x⁻¹ might work.  Some cases can be excluded trivially because they do not reduce to subtraction in the abelian case, others can be excluded by reflection groups: for instance it is not possible to express group operations in terms of (x,y)↦xyxy⁻¹x⁻¹y⁻¹, because in the dihedral group generated by s,t with s²=t²=(st)³=1 the submagma generated by s,t is simply {1,s,t}.

So we have \"implication\", \"finite implication\", and then these four different kinds of definability. All the kinds of definability have their own finite version.
