Here are the top clusters by how often they occur and their inbound,outbound count:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">121</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">4119</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">2913</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">123</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">4119</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">2988</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">152</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">3480</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">3034</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">419</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">3138</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">2767</span>\n<span class=\"mi\">1508</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">3186</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I found it interesting how many equations clustered into the same inbound/outbound counts. This could very well be an artifact of having a finite number of formulas, but for formulas that I looked at, the equations do look structurally related.</p>\n<p>The largest cluster, is 1508 equations that no-imply 0 equations, but are not-implied by all the other 3186 equations. This is the cluster consisting of Equations 2, 6, 7, 15, 17, etc.  In my data counting trivial implications, this cluster of 1508 equations all are implied by other formulas in the cluster except for Equation 2 at the root. If I understand it correctly, none of the Equations in this cluster are realizable for magmas of size &gt;1, so it seems like there should be a proof that all are impossible to generate (for size &gt;1) and hence equivalent, instead of the weaker implications I am generating by manipulating rewrites.</p>",
