To allow <code>lake exe cache get</code> to work on gitpod, I very simply copied the files</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">gitpod.yml</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">docker</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">gitpod</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">Dockerfile</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>to my project and opened it in gitpod.  Gitpod took a couple of minutes to set everything up.  While it was setting up, I had the impression that several instructions were not actually working, but eventually, I could <code>import Mathlib</code> and it worked well.</p>\n<p>Is this normal?  Should I do something else?  I am mostly concerned by the fact that this will be potentially used by all my students and I am wary of the fact that some of them might have problems and I will not be able to help them at all!</p>\n<p>Note: it is the first time that I use gitpod, so if something looks wrong to you, it probably is!</p>",
