I'm arguing that <code>Prop : Type</code> is just one of these hacks and is not something that one has to take on board and understand in order to get a feeling for the type theory. But this is just my personal interpretation of what is going on. I teach students what (I think) they need to know about the type system (namely element : type, type : <code>Type</code>, proof : statement and statement : <code>Prop</code>) and no more, because I've decided that these are the important statements and everything else that goes on under the hood is confusing and irrelevant. But I'm not teaching a type theory course. I tell them <code>Set X</code> is the type of subsets of <code>X</code> and they don't ask themselves \"how does this work internally in the type theory\" for the same reason that they've never queried why the set of subsets of a set is a valid mathematical object in the informal set theory that they see used in other classes.</p>",

With the forall something special is happening, where the result is in a smaller universe, Prop. I believe that this is Prop being what's called an \"impredicative universe\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for pointing that out <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306601\">@Kyle Miller</span> !

They are one of the core types of expressions, and they appear as <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Lean.Expr.forallE#doc\">docs#Lean.Expr.forallE</a> in the implementation of Lean. The rule about what its type is is explicitly encoded in the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Lean.Meta.inferType#doc\">docs#Lean.Meta.inferType</a> function.
