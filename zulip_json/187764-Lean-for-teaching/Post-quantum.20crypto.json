I need to start thinking about teaching for Fall '24 and it is clear that Lean is mature enough to handle everything in that course. But a greater focus on post-quantum algorithms might better survive the test of time. </p>\n<p>I haven't thought deeply about how to structure the course. If people have thoughts, please share.</p>",
