What are some easy to read proofs on Mathlib4 (at undergraduate math level) that are somewhat close to their natural language versions?</p>\n<p>I usually just default to the \"infinity of primes\" proof. I'd like to mix things up a bit and also am myself curious about this. </p>\n<p>When I skimmed through the library, proofs of many results that I thought were basic used a hierarchy of instances and we're very far from a natural language proof. I haven't yet looked at the IMO problems but I am hopeful of finding some good examples there.</p>",
