Monday's fine. I'm not an expert on Observable so I'm not sure, but it seems to me that it's ideal for when you want people to be able to play around with \"everything\" in the page, including the javascript. If I understand it correctly, whether it's a website or observable, the codes to make it more beautiful and shiny must be written and are almost the same codes, but Observable might limit how much we will be able to control the design.
