I really like it because each step has a lots of tests and they are small enough to be tackled with little experience but the projects themselves are big enough to learn about maintenability, good practices... all that.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there could be something similar for Lean, so here I have a first trial, <a href=\"https://github.com/juanjomadrigal/lean-crafter\">https://github.com/juanjomadrigal/lean-crafter</a> . </p>\n<p>Right now it only has one project, proving an IMO problem, but I hope to upload more projects in the future. </p>\n<p>The system of \"checks\" is quite primitive; it is also very different to try to check definitions than to try to check propositions or proofs or propositions... but all in all I think it works more or less.</p>\n<p>Do you think this \"learning by projects\" can be useful for people learning Lean?</p>",
