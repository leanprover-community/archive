While we did consider using Lean4, the base we were building on from the natural number game was in Lean3 and we didn't have much experience with Lean in the browser (I spent several hours figuring out how to update the version of lean3 that is used by lean-game-maker), so we thought it would be best to stick with Lean3.<br>\nThat said, from my experience with Lean4 in making a PR to mathlib4 (sorry about not finishing the docs for that yet), it does seem nice and I think that its syntax would be easier for students than Lean3's syntax since it is closer to Python's syntax. At this time I am quite busy so I wouldn't take up the project myself, but if someone else starts it I would be interested in contributing.</p>",
