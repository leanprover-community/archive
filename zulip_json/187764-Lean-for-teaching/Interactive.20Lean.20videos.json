As I mentioned in #new-members, I've developed software for making interactive videos for teaching. \"Interactive\" means students can e.g. run code inside the video, or manipulate graphs inside the video (examples below).</p>\n<p>I would like to add support for recording interactive Lean tutorials. As a first step, it would be helpful for me to chat with someone who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is very familiar with <code>lean4web</code> / interacting with a Lean server programmatically</li>\n<li>has experience deploying a Lean server to a cloud environment like AWS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would also be great to hear from folks interested in recording such videos themselves.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://epiplexis.xyz/old/insertion-sort\">https://epiplexis.xyz/old/insertion-sort</a> seek to 9:29; the <code>Playground</code> tab is a buffer where you can edit and run your own Python code, while <code>Copy</code> will copy the code I wrote into the playground.
