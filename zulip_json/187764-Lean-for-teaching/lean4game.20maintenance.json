One of the dependencies requires us to go from TypeScript 4 to 5. I've made a PR to do a modest update (just bump minor versions): <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/pull/447\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/pull/447</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't the right channel for this, let me know. There doesn't seem to be a channel dedicated to lean4game.</p>",
