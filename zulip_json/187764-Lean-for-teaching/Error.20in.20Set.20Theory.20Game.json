That means you can only apply <code>h</code> to something of type <code>Set U</code>.  Since <code>F</code> has type <code>Set (Set U)</code>, it doesn't make sense to apply <code>h</code> to <code>F</code>.  That's why Lean is complaining.</p>\n<p>If you had something in your context of type <code>Set U</code> -- in particular, something that is an element of <code>F ∪ G</code> -- then it would make sense to apply <code>h</code> to it.  But you don't have anything like that in your context, so it seems unlikely that applying <code>h</code> is a good next step.  I would look more closely at the goal.  Have you thought about what the goal means, and what you would have to do to prove it?</p>\n<p>By the way, there is another mistake in your <code>have</code> step: <code>∀ t ∈ F ∪ G, x ∈ t</code> is shorthand for <code>∀ (t : Set U), t ∈ F ∪ G → x ∈ t</code>.  So if you apply <code>h</code> to some object <code>w</code> of type <code>Set U</code>, then the result will be <code>w ∈ F ∪ G → x ∈ w</code>, not <code>w ∈ F ∪ G, x ∈ w</code>.  In fact, <code>w ∈ F ∪ G, x ∈ w</code> doesn't make sense -- if you want to combine two statements to make a new statement, you have to connect them with a logical connective, not a comma.</p>",
