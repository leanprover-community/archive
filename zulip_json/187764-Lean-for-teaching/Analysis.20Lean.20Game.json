Although it might be worth it, after all I am a Software Developer and used to code. But it might not be worth it for everybody.</p>\n<p>Playing the nng4 game, it was just really cool to have a system that won't let you do anything that is mathematically wrong. It makes the process more efficient. For example, if you come up with a different proof than the math book you are studying with, you don't have to have someone \"peer review\" your solution or anything like that. Lean just does it for you.<br>\nAlso, having the building blocks (theorems) that you need to finish the exercise neatly in a sidebar is also not too bad.</p>\n<p>I just like it a lot more than studying with books for those reasons.</p>\n<p>But I understand your concern as well. Most  people might not be willing to learn lean4 to study analysis.</p>",
