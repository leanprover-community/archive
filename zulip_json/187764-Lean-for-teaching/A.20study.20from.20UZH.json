This study is done as part of the master's thesis of our student <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"612514\">@Mattia Bottoni</span> , co-supervised by Alberto Cattaneo. You may find its arXiv version <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03352\">here</a> and Mattia's thesis on <a href=\"https://www.math.uzh.ch/en/studium/masterarbeit?year=2024\">this UZH webpage</a>.</p>\n<p>We wanted to thank the entire Lean community for their continuous support during his studies. We would also appreciate any comments, feedback, or particularly critiques, as we co-authors are not experts on this topic.</p>\n<p>Thanks so much once more!</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nElif</p>",
