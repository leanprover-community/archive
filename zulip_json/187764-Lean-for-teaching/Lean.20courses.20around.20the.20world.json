I course corrected and made lectures into project demo/help/live-coding. Advanced students explaining what they had done and less advanced explained what they had, where they were stuck, what they  needed etc and I (and their felow students) helped them get unstuck. This is working well. Next time I teach I will transition earlier and in a more planned way to this mode.</p>",

It's the standard syllabus of a US \"intro to proofs\" course for first/second-year undergraduates, covering \"proof techniques\" (cases/existentials/contradiction/induction), good style in proof writing, parity/divisibility/modular arithmetic/GCD/primes, \"sufficiently large\", recurrence relations, injective/surjective/bijective functions, reflexive/symmetric/antisymmetric/transitive relations, and set operations.</p>\n<p>Reflection:  The course is ongoing, but so far so good!   I invested a lot of energy in writing <a href=\"https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/Index_of_Tactics.html\">custom tactics</a> which perform exactly one step of reasoning that I would permit on paper, and deliberately never mentioned several more powerful tactics.  This is very useful if the course is explicitly supposed to teach good style in proof writing.  It lets you off the hook in grading -- you can just say \"that's not enough detail -- Lean wouldn't accept it!\"</p>",

Aimed to approach Lean as mathematicians and future formalisers, establishing proficiency in tactic mode. For the first part of the course we learned the basics of first-order logic in Lean using the tutorials project, before discussing some basics if types and type classes to talk about formalising algebra. Also made use of lftcm2020 exercise sheets, and MiL. Concluded with a hackathon working on some group projects.</p>\n<p>Reflections: We tried to avoid touching on too much type theory early on to get people confidently interacting with Lean quickly. In retrospect, it would have been good to cover this in more depth (albeit only later in the course, after establishing confidence interacting with Lean) to aid in dealing with the inevitable issues that arise when formalising an interesting piece of mathematics. Also, we originally aimed for the outcome of the course to be group projects working on mathlib contributions, but would now say that re-framing the goal as formalising something new in a format that is useful to you as a learner (e.g. as a worksheet/interactive part of a textbook) is a better goal pedagogically (and could still lead to, e.g., a mathlib contribution in the process even if that isn't the explicit goal).</p>",
