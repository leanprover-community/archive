The natural number game is also being ported, but I hope to rewrite some chunks of it and add some new stuff, and it's a case of finding the time.</p>",

Really glad that the transfer to Lean4 is moving ahead and moving fast. My intended audience in September will be, in the American university system, mostly seniors and first-year graduate students. So, I don't think I will  need advanced bits of mathlib. And I'm really glad the Nat Number Game will be playable in Lean4 (really tomorrow already?). In Sept,  I will ask my students to take time to play NNG on their own, perhaps in the first one-two weeks of the semester, after which I hope they will be able to solve homework assignments for which they will need no more more than the features of Lean already introduced in the NNG.</p>",
