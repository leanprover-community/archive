We were using an autograder written by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"352951\">@Jacob Neumann</span>  which was coded in lean3. Now we need to implement a new autograder soon (teaching starts end of September) :-( </p>\n<p>Any help and advice or examples of existing autograders which fit our purpose would be very much appreciated. We would like to keep it simple.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\n<p>P.S. For obvious reasons I do not copy the exercises here but I can provide them on request.</p>",
