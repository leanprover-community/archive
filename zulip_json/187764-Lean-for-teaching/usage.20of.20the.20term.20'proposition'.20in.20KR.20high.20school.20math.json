So we will restrict ourselves to sentences of this sort, and define a sentence as a sentence that can be true or false.</p>\n<p>You should not confuse the idea of a sentence that can be true or false with the difference between fact and opinion. Often, sentences in logic will express things that would count as facts— such as ‘Rudolf Carnap was born in Ronsdorf’ or ‘Simone de Beauvoir liked taking walks’. They can also express things that you might think of as matters of opinion—such as, ‘Rhubarb is tasty’. In other words, a sentence is not disqualified from being part of an argument because we don’t know if it is true or false, or because its truth or falsity is a matter of opinion. If it is the kind of sentence that could be true or false it can play the role of premise or conclusion.</p>\n<p>Also, there are things that would count as ‘sentences’ in a linguistics or grammar course that we will not count as sentences in logic.

Both responded that (a) isn't a proposition.</p>\n<p>However, they were divided on whether (b) is a proposition. One of them said that (b) is also a proposition since we <em>can</em> determine its truth or falsehood. The other argued that <em>linguistically</em> speaking (\"국어적으로 해석한다면\"), we can determine the truth or falsehood of (b), but <em>mathematically</em> speaking, it can't be a proposition.</p>",
