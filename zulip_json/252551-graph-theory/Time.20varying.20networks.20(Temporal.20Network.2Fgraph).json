Basically each edge is labeled with a natural number, corresponding to the time where it is \"open\"/\"available\" (some sources allow a set of natural numbers). Then you want to study structures which respect these times, e.g. the labels in a temporal path must be non-decreasing, which would correspond to waiting at a vertex until the next edge is available.</p>",

At long term I was thinking of returning a list of natural corresponding to several times of existance.</p>",
