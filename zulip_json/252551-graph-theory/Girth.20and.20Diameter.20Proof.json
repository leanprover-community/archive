Would it be best to begin the implementation of it using a cycle graph, or by ways of using a cyclic subgraph, or moreover simply by defining it as a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex and then going from there? I appreciate any advice or thoughts on this matter.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/0dmGmvG-zdCTh8o7y0c3Des9/diam.webp\" title=\"diam.webp\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"1345x622\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/0dmGmvG-zdCTh8o7y0c3Des9/diam.webp/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
