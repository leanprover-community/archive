The formalization is very much tailored towards that purpose but if you think that this might be useful for a more general audience, I would be up for contributing something like this to mathlib :)<br>\n(If you don't think that this is useful, then this is of course fine too.)</p>\n<p>I've also given a talk about this at the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"476619\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/476619-Leaning-In.21\">#Leaning In!</a> workshop recently. <br>\n<a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"476619\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/476619-Leaning-In.21/topic/Possibly.20Infinite.20Trees.20of.20Finite.20Degree/with/505626336\">#Leaning In! &gt; Possibly Infinite Trees of Finite Degree</a> <br>\n(Video available <a href=\"https://youtu.be/a8tbPYsLGvE\">here</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"a8tbPYsLGvE\" href=\"https://youtu.be/a8tbPYsLGvE\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/15cbfb45587163049061413c8323802267cefc79/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f613874625059734c4776452f6d7164656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><p>I had already posted about this in the mathlib4 channel but unfortunately did not get a response.
