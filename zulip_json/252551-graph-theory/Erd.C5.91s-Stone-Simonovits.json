        "content": "<p>Hi all. For my undergrad pure maths honors thesis this year I learnt Lean and formalized the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Stone_theorem\">Erdős-Stone-Simonovits theorem</a> writing a thesis about the process. If you care to take a look, the code is here <a href=\"https://github.com/mitchell-horner/ErdosStoneSimonovits\">https://github.com/mitchell-horner/ErdosStoneSimonovits</a>. (I don't claim that this is the best way to do it, just a way that very closely mimicked the pen-and-paper proofs I came up with. <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span>)<br>\nI asked my supervisor(s) and looked online to find the various forms the Erdős-Stone-Simonovits theorem comes in and tried to formalize most of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If r, t are natural numbers and ε&gt;0 a real number then there exists N such that all simple graphs with n&gt;N vertices with at least (1-1/r+ε)*n^2/2 edges contain a copy of the complete equi-partite graph K_{r+1}(t) as an isomorphic subgraph.</li>\n<li>If χ(H) = r+1 &gt; 1 and ε&gt;0 a real number then there exists N such that (1-1/r-ε)*n^2/2 &lt; ex(n, H) ≤ (1-1/r+ε)*n^2/2 for all n &gt; N . (ex(n, H) is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Stone_theorem#Statement_for_arbitrary_non-bipartite_graphs\">extremal number</a> of H with n vertices, χ(H) is the chromatic number of H.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the asymptotic varieties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If χ(H) = r+1 &gt; 1 then ex(n, H) = (1-1/r+o(1))*n^2/2.</li>\n<li>If χ(H) = r+1 &gt; 1 then π(H) = 1-1/r. (π(H) is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Stone_theorem#Tur%C3%A1n_density\">Turán density</a> of H.)</li>\n<li>If χ(H) = r+1 &gt; 2 then ex(n, H) ~ (1-1/r)*(n.choose 2).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I understand that the mathlib library is generally considered for more \"fundamental\" type results, which might not include extremal combinatorics like the Erdős-Stone-Simonovits theorem (even though this theorem was called the \"fundamental\" theorem of extremal graph theory by Bollobás <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span>). However, I think the Bipartite.lean, Extremal.lean, SpecialGraphs.lean, TuranDensity.lean files contain useful results about bipartite graphs for double counting, extremal definitions, definitions about complete equi-partite graphs and results about Turán density that might be \"fundamental\" enough to include. I'm relatively new so have no clue to the PR process, or if these results would be more appropriate in some dedicated combinatorics library elsewhere. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>",
