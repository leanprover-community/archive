I looked at the upsteaming file, some quick notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For mathlib style, numerical indices like h1 should subscripts, e.g. h\\1</li>\n<li>You can use dot notation to shorten some proofs, e.g. if <code>foo</code> has type List, you can use <code>foo.bar</code> instead of <code>List.bar foo</code>.</li>\n<li>For <code>chain'_mem_notMem_of_nodup_prefix_length_lt</code>, there's two things proved and the first doesn't have to do with List.Chain' so those should be separate, and the second conclusion seem like it may just be a form of <code>chain'_rel_of_idx_consec</code> so perhaps it is subsumed at that</li>\n<li>Incidentally, I have a form of <code>chain'_rel_of_idx_consec</code> under review at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/25812\">#25812</a></li>\n<li><code>pop_size_lt</code> can be proved <code>by grind</code>, which means perhaps it should just be inlined wherever it's used as such.</li>\n</ul>",
