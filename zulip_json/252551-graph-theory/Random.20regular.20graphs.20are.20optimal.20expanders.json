        "content": "<p>Hi! I have been setting up a project aiming to prove Alon's conjecture / Friedman's theorem, namely that random regular graphs are near-optimal expanders. This is an influential result in spectral graph theory which was historically very difficult to prove, but a new very clean and short proof has recently emerged.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the proof I want to use relies on random graphs obtained from random permutations, and will have some loops and multi-edges. This project therefore requires to develop Graph, and I hope it can be a motivation to do so. I am not very experienced in Lean and I would be very happy to welcome people to the project; there is a lot to do, with very different types of maths / level of challenge I think. I also highlighted a few side-projects I think would be interesting in the blueprint.</p>\n<p>Links: the <a href=\"https://github.com/lauramonk/FriedmanStrongConv\">github repo</a></p>",

I have some very basic random matrix theory lemmas and am working on some moment method arguments on a project on the Semicircle Law (<a href=\"https://github.com/FredRaj3/SemicircleLaw\">github</a>). It's still a work in progress but some of it might be of use. I introduced something called a LoopWalk which is basically a walk on a simple graph that allows for loops at a vertex (it doesn't have multiple edges yet). I avoided using Graph since it was pretty underdeveloped when I started, but this might be a time to build it up.</p>",

graphs (I am not familiar with the graph theory library yet though). Exactly how you do it probably depends on what will make the arguments convenient . In particular if all the probabilitistic arguments takes place in the random matrix setting (and all the graph theory arguments are deterministic arguments) then you would prefer something that works nice for doing random matrix theory (and even within random matrix theory the nature of the arguments will effect what works best I think).</p>",
