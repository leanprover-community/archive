This probably looks weird, since it's not at all used in mathematics – except when the equivalence classes are order connected, in which case a linear order can descend to the quotient (this is sometimes called a \"condensation\", I believe). This is a necessary ingredient for <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/29687\">#29687</a>.</p>\n<p>There's some prior (albeit disorganized) discussion on <a href=\"#narrow/channel/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Quotient.20of.20linear.20order.20is.20linear.20order/near/539915988\">Zulip</a>. The main questions seem to be two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it ok to have such a general instance? On the one hand most quotients don't care for or even want this weird order instance; on the other most practical quotients are already behind aliases, so they won't even get this instance.</li>\n<li>What API should exist for these instances? My PR is very minimal in that regard, though apparently there's a bunch of other ways to write down the definition for <code>≤</code>.</li>\n</ul>",
