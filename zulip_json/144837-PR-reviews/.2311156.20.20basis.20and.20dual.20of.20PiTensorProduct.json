I am also unlikely to acquire these skills unless I want to spend all my available research time on Lean, which I am not willing to do.<br>\nThat being said, preparing something for PR also takes up a large amount of time, merge conflicts pop up frequently and take non-negligible to solve (at least if you're me), and I have many other things that I need to do with my time. You mentioned the March 28 merge conflict, that was the third one, I fixed the first two but at that point I had started wondering whether it was really worth it. I'm not sure what you means by comments, but the PR got no comments from any humans that I can see.</p>",
