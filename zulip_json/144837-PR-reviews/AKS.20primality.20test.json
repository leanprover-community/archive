I'm realistically about 60% through the proof, but it is quite gnarly and technical and there are quite a lot of decisions that I took pragmatically.</p>\n<p>First PR is <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/34507\">#34507</a> and that finishes Claim 1. It is about 10-20% of the estimated proof size.</p>\n<p>Here are some questions. I designed this file to have one public declaration only which is the proof_wanted in the bottom of the PR. The rest are private declarations. I'm not sure if the introspective relation is worth having as a public declaration as it seems to be relevant for this proof only. Is this approach fine?</p>\n<p>Here's the proof that I'm formalising <a href=\"https://academicweb.nd.edu/~andyp/notes/AKS.pdf\">https://academicweb.nd.edu/~andyp/notes/AKS.pdf</a> It's theorem 6.1. Claim (i) is done in the PR. I don't know if it makes sense to share my local file. It is already 400 LoC and it's not cleaned up yet.</p>\n<p>I'd like to have smaller managed PR's so that I don't overwhelm the review process.</p>",
