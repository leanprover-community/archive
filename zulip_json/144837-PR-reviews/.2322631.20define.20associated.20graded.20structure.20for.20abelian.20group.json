As we defined IsFiltration before in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20900\">#20900</a>, do we need to wrap the filtration with the ring to form a <code>FilteredRing</code> structure. I found out this problem as <code>AssociatedGraded</code> need the filtration as imput. Do anyone have some suggestions? Thanks.</p>",
