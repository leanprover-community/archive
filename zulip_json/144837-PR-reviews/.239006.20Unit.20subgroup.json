This operation (which I am calling <code>Submonoid.units</code>) forms the upper half of a Galois coinsertion with the forgetful coercion of a subgroup of <code>Mˣ</code> to a submonoid of <code>M</code>, and so I also define the latter as <code>Subgroup.ofUnits</code> and add appropriate lemmas for it.</p>\n<p>There's also a couple of others equivalences in here which I didn't have a clear place for.</p>\n<p>Previous discussion on this has been in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Submonoid.20units\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Submonoid.20units</a>, but now that I have cleaned it up and turned it into a PR, this seemed a more appropriate place to discuss it.</p>\n<p>I am looking for suggestions of other lemmas (in particular I have some but not all versions of lemmas that come from the Galois coinsertion), and any structural suggestions people otherwise have. I believe I have addressed all style issues (certainly it passes style and lint checks!)</p>",
