Namely, <code>Mathlib/Combinatorics/SetFamily/Shadow</code> times out at the call to <code>aesop</code> in the proof of <code>mem_shadow_iterate_iff_exists_card</code>. We tried increasing the <code>maxHeartbeats</code>, and also increasing <code>maxRuleApplications</code> in the aesop options (as prompted), but it's still timing out. Any help please?... (Maybe there's an infinite loop here??)</p>",
