An important note: The way that <code>Category* C</code> works is by looking at the universe parameters in <code>C</code> itself and its type, and placing the new universe param before all of those. OTOH, <code>Category.!{*} C</code> works by creating a level param <code>v</code>, considering <code>Category.{v,_} C</code>, elaborating it as <code>Category.{v,u} C</code> for some <code>u</code>, then placing <code>v</code> before any level params appearing in <code>u</code>.  So, if we have <code>C.{u} : Type 0</code>,  then <code>Category* C</code> will place <code>v</code> before <code>u</code> while <code>Category.!{*} C</code> will place it after <code>u</code>. </p>\n<p>I got Claude to write various tests for this PR. If anyone wants additional tests, let me know and I will happily add them.</p>",
