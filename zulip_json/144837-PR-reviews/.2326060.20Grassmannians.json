The main complaint seems to be that it uses a different indexing than the convention, because I have used the index for the dimension of the quotient, rather than the dimension of the submodule.</p>\n<p>Basically, convention is that Gr(k,V) = { subspaces of V with dimension k }, but I have chosen Gr(k,M) = { quotients of M with dimension k }.</p>\n<p>But I am absolutely convinced that in this case it's actually the existing convention that is <em>wrong</em> here. The indexing of the dimension of submodule only makes sense in a field with a finite dimensional vector space, and cannot be generalised.</p>",
