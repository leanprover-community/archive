We only assume that the space is T2 and normal (no metrizability, no second-countability). I know there is a version of this theorem in the central limit project, but with stronger assumptions, so instead I give a more conceptual proof using Riesz-Markov-Kakutani.</p>\n<p>I have split a few preliminary PRs:</p>",
