This PR ports some basic topological properties of <code>ENat</code> from Peter Nelson's matroid project. It ports just enough to turn <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15344\">#15344</a> into a single line term proof (similar to its equivalent in <code>ENNReal</code>). I intentionally ported only the basics, with hopes for the rest to be added eventually, to ease the review process as  <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15344\">#15344</a> depends on this. Reviews highly appreciated!</p>",
