This PR should be easy but two following PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16992\">#16992</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16993\">#16993</a> all depend on this so I am asking for some review, thank you.<br>\n Also if we doesn't mind small overlaping of two different PR then maybe we can straightly go to the two mentioned above.</p>",
