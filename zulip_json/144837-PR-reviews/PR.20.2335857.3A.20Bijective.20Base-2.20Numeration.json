Unlike standard binary representation, bijective base-2 avoids the \"leading zeros\" problem, providing a strict mathematical bijection between natural numbers (ℕ) and lists of booleans (List Bool). All CI checks are passing. Since I am a new contributor, I would greatly appreciate it if a maintainer could take a look or add the appropriate labels to put it in the review queue. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
