In some sense its an inverse to <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/group_theory/sylow.html#sylow.card_eq_multiplicity\">sylow.card_eq_multiplicity</a>. See also the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Inverse.20to.20sylow.2Ecard_eq_multiplicity/near/323260779\">previous discussion</a>.</p>\n<p>I decided to not add the lemma <code>set_like.eq_of_subset_of_card_le</code>, as it is just the composition of <code>set_like'.ext</code>and <code>set.eq_of_subset_of_card_le</code>. Also, the best place to put it might have been <code>data.set_like.finite</code>and this file is apparently in the process of being ported to lean4.</p>",
