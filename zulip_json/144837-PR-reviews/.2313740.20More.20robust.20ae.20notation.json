However, the latter is a bit weak in the sense that it doesn't make use of the expected types of <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> to elaborate <code>μ</code>. This results in a few elaboration errors in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13740\">#13740</a>. Does anyone have advice on how to make this elaborator more robust?</p>",
