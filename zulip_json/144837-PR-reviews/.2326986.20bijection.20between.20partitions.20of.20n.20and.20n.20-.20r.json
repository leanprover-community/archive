I've opened <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/26986\">PR#26986</a>, which adds a bijective lemma in the context of integer partitions.</p>\n<p>Specifically, it shows that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The number of partitions of <code>n</code> that contain <code>r</code> as a part and have all parts ≤ <code>r</code><br>\nequals the number of partitions of <code>n - r</code> whose largest part is ≤ <code>r</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The proof constructs an explicit bijection between these two sets using the existing <code>Partition</code> structure in <code>Mathlib.Data.Nat.Partition</code>. Both directions are implemented, the bijection is proven to be mutual inverses, and <code>Fintype.card_congr</code> is applied.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering whether this should live in a more specialized file or if the current location is fine. Feedback on naming, structure, or proof style is very welcome — thanks!</p>",
