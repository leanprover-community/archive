To help them upstreaming, I have created the branch and made a minor cleanup (a first review, if you like). Am I still in a position to review the branch and merge it in the end, or is it better if it's done by someone else? In such cases, does it look reasonable if I'm entitled to a <code>maintainer merge</code> but not a <code>bors merge</code>, for instance?</p>",
