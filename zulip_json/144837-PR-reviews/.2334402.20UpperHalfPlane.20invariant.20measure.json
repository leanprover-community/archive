The PR – which was written by me and then substantially reworked by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> – has been idle for 3 weeks, other than merges for master updates. I would be grateful for a review of this PR, as it is somewhat blocking progress in modular form theory.</p>",
