Currently, my opinion is that <code>mulLeftCLM</code> should use junk value, but for the old <code>bilinLeftCLM</code> should stay as it is. Reason being that <code>bilinLeftCLM</code> is used also to define <code>pairing</code> and there it is very desirable to have the defeq right. For <code>mulLeftCLM</code> (and the version for tempered distributions) you want to use junk values, because it will involve complicated expressions for treating Fourier multipliers.<br>\nIt would be nice having some input here.</p>",
