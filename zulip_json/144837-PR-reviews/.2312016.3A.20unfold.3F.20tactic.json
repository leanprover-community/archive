It's part of a bigger interactive tactic helping to rewrite specific supexpressions.</p>\n<p>In general it is one of these self-replacing tactics that will not end up in final mathlib code, and I think it's a cool feature.</p>\n<p>The PR is well-documented, has tests, and might just need a final review (and merge) by a maintainer.</p>",
