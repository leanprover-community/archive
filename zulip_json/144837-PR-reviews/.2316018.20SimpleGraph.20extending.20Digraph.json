The code is originally mine, and Jack was kind enough to work on the material and create a PR.</li>\n<li>Later we can discuss how to unify some of the material. (It's possible that having <code>SimpleGraph</code> extend <code>Digraph</code> works better than it used to, but there's still an issue that a simple graph isn't a digraph; there's simply a way to regard a simple graph as being a digraph by using pairs of directed edges. I think something close to the class-based solution for inheritance that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span> proposed long ago is probably the right solution.)</li>\n</ul>",
