This is something we can hopefully leverage more widely in future to reduce turnaround on PRs with trivial issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main caveat is that it is currently quite basic, it won't reflow lines or anything fancy, but it will delete disallowed <code>set_option</code>s change lower <code>.</code> to middle <code>Â·</code> and remove spaces before semicolons, in exactly situations where the linter complained before.<br>\nThe other issue is that it is written in python still and would be nicer if rewritten in lean as that may allow some parts to be migrated to the actual linter framework, but hopefully this is still a useful intermediate step.</p>",
