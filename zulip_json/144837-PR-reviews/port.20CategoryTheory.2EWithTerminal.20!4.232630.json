The situation is that we frequently have a hypothesis <code>f : star ⟶ of X</code>, where this hom space is just defined as <code>PEmpty</code>. We'd like to have <code>aesop_cat</code> automatically perform case analysis whenever it sees such a hypothesis, but I'm not sure how to request this. Adding  a <code>cases</code> rule on <code>PEmpty</code> isn't enough, because it can't see through the definition. Adding an <code>apply</code> rule for <code>PEmpty.elim</code> unsurprisingly runs off the rails.</p>",
