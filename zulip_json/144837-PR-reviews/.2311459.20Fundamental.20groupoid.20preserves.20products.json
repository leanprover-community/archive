The main issue with using the category theory language for <code>preserves_products</code> is first we would need to show <code>has_products Groupoid</code>. I added this feature in the latest commit, but I'm not sure it's a good idea to do it this way.</p>\n<p>Specifically, first of all, it is not very general. We should show that Grpd has all limits. Moreover, I couldn't even find where it is proven that Cat has limits/has products, if it is in mathlib at all, so I had no real model to go off of.</p>\n<p>Finally, and perhaps most crucially, showing that <code>Groupoid</code> has products involves a lot of <code>functor.ext</code>, which according to the documentation is not good to use. Instead, we should be using some kind of natural transformation, but I'm not really sure how to write that.</p>\n<p>Note that these modifications don't significantly depend on the other results in the PR, so it might be better to separate them out into a new branch. In any case, what is the best course of action regarding the language we use to saw that the fundamental groupoid functor preserves products:</p>\n<p>- The current way, which just shows that <code>category_theory.Groupoid.of (Π i : I, (π.obj (X i)).α) ≅ (π.obj (Top.of (Π i, X i)))</code>, with the inverse functor being the product of the induced projection maps <br>\n  - Implement <code>has_products Groupoid</code> for now the way it is implemented, and use it to say that <code>fundamental_groupoid_functor</code> preserves products using category theory language (but it might be refactored later)<br>\n  - Implement <code>has_products Groupoid</code> in another (cleaner?) way</p>",

Mathlib has extensive API about cones and limits that you can take advantage of, while the 2-limit API will need time to take shape.
