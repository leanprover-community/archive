It does have some overlap but I believe it's worth having the API for the function from <code>Ordinal</code> to itself (or, at least, the notation---the PR is mostly this plus straightening out <code>ω₁</code>).<br>\nSpeaking of API, I think <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6404/files#diff-be861c52d9c0367122b865568b249e2518a64e73115318552fa3e762df821a88\">this lemma</a> on <code>Cardinal.ord</code> was missing.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",
