        "content": "<p>This series of PR aims at formalising the result that the simplex category can be presented by \"generators and relation\", the generating morphisms being the <code>σ i</code> and the <code>δ i</code>, and the relations being the simplicial identities proven in <code>AlgebraicTopology/SimplexCategory.lean</code>. The main consequence for this is that one can define simplicial objects with <em>a priori</em> less data (providing functoriality only for faces and degeneracies, instead of functoriality for every monotone map between finite ordinals). Similarly, it gives that it also suffices to check naturality for those map in order to get naturality for every map.</p>\n<p>The total diff is big (+2.281) as the result is technical by nature, the key technical point being that one can find nice \"normal forms\" for morphisms. Hence, the project has been split in 8 separate PRs. See the github tracking issue (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21749\">#21749</a>) for more explanation on what is done in each PR, and how the full proof is organized.</p>\n<p>I expect this will take a lot of work to review, and I don’t expect it would be merged as is, since I probably missed some golfs / did things in suboptimal ways, but hopefully we’ll get through it.</p>",
