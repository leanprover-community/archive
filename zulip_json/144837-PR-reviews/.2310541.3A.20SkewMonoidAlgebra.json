We then updated this PR on <time datetime=\"2024-04-14T22:00:00Z\">2024-04-15T00:00:00+02:00</time>  to try and match the planned refactor  by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321459\">@Damiano Testa</span> , see discussion <a href=\"#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Separate.20.60Finsupp.60.20from.20.60AddMonoidAlgebra.60/near/421624155\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I wanted to ask here whether there are any news regarding a review? The shape of this work is important for upcoming work. In particular, we wish to define <code>SkewPolynomial</code>. We have ideas where to go from there but this is assuming no major change to the current version of <code>SkewMonoidAlgebra</code>. In other words: It would be nice to have a review before we continue.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot!<br>\nXavier</p>",

I then started a merge of the two with a <code>to_additive</code> like tool for getting them to work in parallel, but that will probably take a long time to be reviewed.</p>\n<p>The conclusion is that your PR should not depend implicitly or explicitly on the <code>(Add)MonoidAlgebra</code> refactor.</p>",

(see <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1680461414\">here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For <code>(p : MonoidAlgebra k G)</code> and <code>(a : G)</code>, this instance allows one to write <code>p a</code> to represent the value of <code>p</code> at <code>a</code>. This is what is currently done in <code>MonoidAlgebra</code>, but as there is a planned refactor that intends to separate <code>MonoidAlgebra</code> from <code>Finsupp</code>, and thus breaking the direct connection of <code>MonoidAlgebra</code> with it's corresponding finitely supported function, this will probably change?</p>\n<p>In other words: Should we keep this or create a function akin to <code>Polynomial.coeff</code>?</p>\n<p>The planned refactor of <code>MonoidAlgebra</code> is an ongoing project of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321459\">@Damiano Testa</span>  but will take some time to happen (see above). I also wanted to ask the question publicly to have more opinions.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help!<br>\nXavier</p>",
