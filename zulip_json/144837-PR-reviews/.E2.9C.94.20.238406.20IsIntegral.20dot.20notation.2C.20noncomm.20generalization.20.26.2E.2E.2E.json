        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/8406\">#8406</a> touches 38 files (due to renames to enable dot notation) so it's highly likely to conflict with other PRs, and I'd appreciate speedy review/delegation. It golfs some long proofs which collectively makes mathlib4 226 lines leaner, but only adds two new lemmas, removes an auxiliary lemma, and deduplicates some lemmas, so it's hopefully not hard to review.</p>\n<p>The PR can't be easily split, as the renamed/reordered lemmas are also used in the golfs.</p>\n<p>(I was encouraged by <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/8358\">#8358</a> to add more dot notations, and they do shorten proofs as you can see.)</p>",
