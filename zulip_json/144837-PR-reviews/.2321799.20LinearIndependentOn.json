        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21799\">#21799</a> adds a predicate <code>LinearIndependentOn R v s</code> stating that the vectors in the family <code>v</code> that are indexed by the elements of a set <code>s</code> are linearly independent over the ring <code>R</code>. This is analogous to <code>ContinuousOn</code>, and seems to be <a href=\"http://LinearIndependentOn%20predicate%20#21799\">the result of the discussion here</a>. </p>\n<p>This PR just adds the definition and some very simple lemmas. Expanding the API, and changing the spelling of some existing lemmas about sets of vectors to use the new predicate, will come after.</p>",
