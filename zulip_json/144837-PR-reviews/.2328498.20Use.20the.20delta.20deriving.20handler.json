I wonder if they're meant to be <code>abbrev</code>s, or if they're meant to be <code>def</code>s with derived instances. Seems worth addressing in a future PR.</li>\n<li>Some definitions require \"refolding\" an unrelated definition. This seems to only affect deriving <code>Functor.Full</code> and <code>Functor.Faithful</code> for the functor out of an induced category. For example, the Full and Faithful instances on <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CategoryTheory.fromSkeleton#doc\">docs#CategoryTheory.fromSkeleton</a> are supposed to be in terms of <code>Skeleton</code>, but the derived ones are in terms of <code>InducedCategory</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pinging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"238446\">@Anne Baanen</span>; I see some of the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/380\">mathlib4#380</a> notes were added by you.</p>",
