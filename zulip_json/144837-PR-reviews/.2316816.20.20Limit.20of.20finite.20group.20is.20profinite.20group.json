This PR depend on PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16648\">#16648</a> and would finish proving the \"if\" side. But for the other side I have some questions :<br>\n1 : I defined the structure of closed subgroup and open normal subgroup, is it an appropriate place to put it on the side of OpenSubgroup.lean?<br>\n2 : There are additional lemmas for compact topological group, to prove that there is always a open subgroup in a clopen neihborhood of <code>1</code>, it needs to import OpenSubgroup.lean, so where should I put it?<br>\nThank you</p>",
