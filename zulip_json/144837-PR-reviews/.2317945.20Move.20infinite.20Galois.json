The only work it do is splitting the file <code>Mathlib.FieldTheory.Galois.Infinite</code> into two files currently named <code>Galois.GaloisClosure</code> (construct <code>FiniteGaloisIntermediateField</code> and <code>adjoin</code> about it) and <code>Profinite</code> (will prove that Galois group is profinite later in it). Any suggestions about the naming?<br>\nThis is because in the original file the thing that can be stated seperately is mixed together, doing this can split basic constructions, profinite (stated categorically), and the fundamental theorem completely.<br>\nSorry for causing this trouble because of my lack of overall design.</p>",
