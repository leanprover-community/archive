The issue is that the declarations involving continued fractions are currently quite long so this PR shortens them to abbreviations. In fact, the original names in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1433\">mathlib#1433</a> which added them were similarly short but <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110050\">@Sébastien Gouëzel</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Kim Morrison</span> suggested using longer names instead. </p>\n<p>In my comment I suggested possibly adding abbreviations or notations to those files and then shortening the files everywhere in place of the long names, but thinking over it I can't think of any other places in mathlib where we do that sort of thing, so I'm not sure if that's what we should really do here.</p>",
