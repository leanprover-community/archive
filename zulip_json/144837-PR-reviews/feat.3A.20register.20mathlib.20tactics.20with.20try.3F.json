This explains some of the omissions from <code>hint</code> registrations. (Note that there is the <code>try? +missing</code> flag, which does attempt to build partial proofs with <code>sorry</code>, but there's no current mechanism for user extensions to register with this. Please let me know if this is desirable.)</p>\n<p>I've also not registered <code>linarith</code> and <code>ring</code>, since <code>try?</code> tries <code>grind</code> first, and only attempts user extensions if that (and <code>simp_all</code>, and <code>exact?</code>, and a few others) has failed.</p>",
