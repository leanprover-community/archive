Should we keep those names or possibly rename them, as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"459227\">@Violeta Hernández</span> suggested? <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30759#discussion_r2451804382\">see comment</a></li>\n<li>I made a number of changes to <code>Topology/UniformSpace/Defs.lean</code> fixing up a merge conflict with <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/23181\">#23181</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30759#discussion_r2463038783\">see comments starting here</a> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span> (or anyone else), I'd appreciate a double check on my choices here.</li>\n</ul>",
