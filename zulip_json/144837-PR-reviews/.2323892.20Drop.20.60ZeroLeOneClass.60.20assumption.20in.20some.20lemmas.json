The positivity extension stuff at the bottom seems to be a bit quicker but it's difficult to see any difference. The only other declaration I found where there was a 10% speed up was <code>LinearOrderedSemiField.toDenselyOrdered</code> so I am a bit baffled by this.</p>\n<p>The global <code>linter.countHeartbeats</code> linter would be helpful for this but it seems to be broken.</p>",
