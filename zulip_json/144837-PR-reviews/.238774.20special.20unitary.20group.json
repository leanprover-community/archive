The PR author didn't quite implement them in the correct way, but when attempting to suggest a better one I realized we would need to resolve a question:</p>\n<p>There are two options here, and it's not immediately clear to me which one is the right decision. <code>Matrix.unitaryGroup</code> is just defined as a submonoid (namely the <code>unitary</code> submonoid). If <code>Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup</code> were also a submonoid (it's not defined that way), then we could just take their <code>inf</code>, but <code>Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup</code> is a hand-rolled type.</p>\n<p>So, the question is: do we hand-roll <code>Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup</code> or make it the submonoid which is the <code>inf</code> of <code>Matrix.unitaryGroup</code> and the range of <code>Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup</code> under the coercion homomorphism?</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
