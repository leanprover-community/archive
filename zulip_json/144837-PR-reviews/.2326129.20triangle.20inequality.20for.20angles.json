Am I right to do this?<br>\n2) The definition <code>private noncomputable def ortho (y x : V) : V := x - ⟪x, y⟫ • y</code> at <code>Mathlib/Geometry/Euclidean/Angle/Unoriented/TriangleInequality.lean</code>  gives an useful vector and is meant only for unit length vector <code>y</code>. It can be thought as a part of Gram-Schmidt ortogonalization process, I believe,   but I don't need the full Gram-Schmidt, imo, so I hope that this definition is okay.</p>",
