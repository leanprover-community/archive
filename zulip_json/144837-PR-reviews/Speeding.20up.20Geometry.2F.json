Let me respond to a few points:<br>\nFirst of all: I agree that ideally, adding short-cut instances, squeezing simps or avoid <code>field_simp</code> should not be necessary. I would also prefer living in a world where none of these were needed. That said, particularly <code>Sphere</code> and <code>ContDiff/NormedSpace</code> are really slow: that's beyond the point at which I can work on them nicely. I don't think this is a satisfactory state of affairs. I consider a temporary improvement which can be reverted once tactics have improved worth it.</p>\n<p>I will happily file tracking issues for all these problems: slow nlinarith, slow field_simps and also the short-cut instances.
