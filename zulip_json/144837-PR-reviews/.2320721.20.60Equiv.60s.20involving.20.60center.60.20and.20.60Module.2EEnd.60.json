It has little mathematical content but it's blocking <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20640\">#20640</a> and it looks like it's also useful for the new PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20991\">#20991</a>. It already has one approval.</p>",
