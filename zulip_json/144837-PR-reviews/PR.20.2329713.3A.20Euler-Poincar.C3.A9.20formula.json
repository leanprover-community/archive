This adds the Euler characteristic for chain complexes (<code>ChainComplex.eulerChar</code> and <code>ChainComplex.homologyEulerChar</code>) and proves that the alternating sum of chain dimensions equals the alternating sum of homology dimensions for bounded complexes of finite-dimensional modules over a division ring. Any feedback welcome!</p>",

I'm currently wondering  if I should close that PR, for now, to focus on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/29713\">#29713</a>. I'd base the Euler polyhedron formula work on top of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/29713\">#29713</a>, so in that sense you could consider it still open, but I think it's a bit of noise/spam to keep that open, even as a draft.</p>",
