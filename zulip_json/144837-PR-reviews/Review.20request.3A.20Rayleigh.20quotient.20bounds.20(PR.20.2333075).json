I opened PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33075\">#33075</a>: feat: bound Rayleigh quotient in spans of eigenvectors.<br>\nIt adds Rayleigh quotient bounds for vectors in the span of a finite subfamily of eigenvectors, with a general lemma for a continuous linear operator (orthonormal eigenfamily, real eigenvalues), plus a non-normalized variant and a specialization to symmetric operators.<br>\nCI is green. I’d appreciate a review — any feedback welcome (I’m a new contributor). Thanks!</p>",
