This is useful in its own right, and necessary to even state the basic definition in bordism theory.</p>\n<p>This PR posed a design question, on which I welcome comments: should the <code>n</code>-dimensionality be a typeclass assumption or a proof-valued field. The former could avoid unnecessary boilerplate, say when the dimension is ambient and always fixed.<br>\nHowever, encoding the dimension in a typeclass is inflexible for dimension-changing constructions. Three examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The product of an n- and an m-manifold is an n+m-manifold: I would prefer that a 2+3 and a 4+1-manifold are the same as a 5-manifold; the typeclass system and addition don't mix well.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bordism theory requires such equalities: a cobordism between two 4-manifolds is a certain 5-manifold;<br>\nthe general definition would state this as a 4+1-manifold, which needs to be unified with 5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Surgery between manifolds involves k-handles, the product of a k- and an n-k-manifold (for all k): this uses quite extensively that n=k+(n-k) for all k.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For these reasons, I have decided for the latter option. I am open to also defining a class <code>IsNManifold</code> and adding an instance <code>NManifold -&gt; IsNManifold</code>.</p>\n<p>To show my design is workable, this PR also shows that the product of an n- and an m-manifold is an m+n-manifold (same with closedness), and proves some standard examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the empty set is an n-manifold for each n</li>\n<li><code>n</code>-dimensional Euclidean space is an n-manifold</li>\n<li>the n-sphere is a closed n-manifold</li>\n<li>the two-torus is a closed 2-manifold</li>\n</ul>",
