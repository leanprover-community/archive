It has had a few merge conflicts already. This shall be an important PR in the development of the homotopy theory of simplicial sets, as with the following PRs <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21026\">#21026</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21032\">#21032</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21090\">#21090</a> (and a few more), it will allow the gluing of morphisms in order to construct morphisms from the horns of the standard simplex.</p>",
