It's blocking my generalisation of the rearrangement inequality (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15815\">#15815</a>) and of the special case of Jensen/Cauchy-Schwartz (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11448\">#11448</a>), which in turn is blocking more upstreaming from APAP. Would someone mind reviewing?</p>",
