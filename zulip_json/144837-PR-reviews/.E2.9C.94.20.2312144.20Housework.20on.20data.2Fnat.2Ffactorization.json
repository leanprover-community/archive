I have a vague worry (based on my still rather shaky understanding of github) that if this sits open for a while then that's eventually going to cause a problem for any subsequent edits to that file â€” i.e. if someone opens a PR on that file then when <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12144\">#12144</a> gets merged they'll be hit with a nasty merge conflict.  Is there a standard way (aside from posting in Zulip) to warn people about this until <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12144\">#12144</a> is merged?  Or is this not something to worry about?</p>",
