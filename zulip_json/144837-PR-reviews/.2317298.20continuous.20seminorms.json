I fully understand that this kind of PRs is hard to port, but it's an important piece towards the general Banach-Steinhaus theorem (this has been on hold for quite some time, but I have a pretty clear path in mind to get there). If we can get to a state of \"this looks good but is too annoying to do mid-port\" that's fine, I can port the PR in Lean4 and wait for these files to be unlocked in mathlib4, but I'd like to get at least a mathematical review now.</p>",
