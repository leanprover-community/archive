It \"upstreams\" the type alias <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Finset.Colex#doc\">docs#Finset.Colex</a> and turns it into an alias for arbitrary types, just like <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Lex#doc\">docs#Lex</a>. The idea is to later add order instances on <code>Colex (α → β)</code> and <code>Colex (α →₀ β)</code> (with the latter being relevant to me in the context of the Cantor normal form and nimber arithmetic)</p>",
