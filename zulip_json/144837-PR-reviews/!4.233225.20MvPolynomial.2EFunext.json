However I haven't moved the smaller lemmas to their correct homes.</p>\n<p>I propose that we just do this without backporting them to mathlib3.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in this PR I really wanted to use <code>refine</code> inside a <code>conv</code> block, which isn't currently setup, so I just added a local macro. We should either leave a porting note on this, or actually install it as a global macro somewhere.</p>",
