I am not. There are current 97 PRs there ready for review. I think we need to plan for wrapping this up at some point. At the current rate of progress we are no more than 3-4 months from closing mathlib3, I think. (Assuming we don't close for PRs before the very last file is ported, which is a dubious assumption?)
