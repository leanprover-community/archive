Nearly all of these changes are to files that have already been ported, but there are a few minor changes to not-yet-ported files (<code>quasi_separated</code> and <code>quasi_compact</code>). Thus it's probably best that we do this in mathlib3 and forward port, however tedious that is.</p>\n<p>The further changes needed are unfortunately a bit more difficult, because the <code>@[elementwise]</code> attribute isn't currently coping with the changes I need to make. <code>elementwise</code> is actually implemented differently in mathlib4, so we might just cross our fingers that the problem has magically gone away there. :-)</p>\n<p>I'm on board with Johan's suggestion that a TODO about the universes is fine for your PR. However I'd appreciate if my changes aren't lost. :-)</p>",
