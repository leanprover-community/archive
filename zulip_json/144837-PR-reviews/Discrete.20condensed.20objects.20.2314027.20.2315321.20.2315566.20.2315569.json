This proves that the sections of a discrete condensed set are given by locally constant maps. <br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15566\">#15566</a> which proves that discreteness of condensed sets can be stated in terms of preserving certain filtered colimits.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15569\">#15569</a> which relates discreteness of a condensed module with discreteness of the underlying condensed set.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15566\">#15566</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15569\">#15569</a> are mutually independent but both depend on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15321\">#15321</a>. </p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/14027\">#14027</a> puts everything together in big <code>tfae</code> statements. </p>\n<p>Each PR is about 400 lines, a bit big but it doesn't make sense to split them up further.
