The point of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/29207\">#29207</a> is to make the diff of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/25273\">#25273</a> as clear as possible. As a result, its own diff is kind of messed up, but I claim that's okay since all changes are purely cosmetic.</p>",
