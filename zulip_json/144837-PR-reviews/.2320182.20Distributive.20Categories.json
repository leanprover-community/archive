        "content": "<p>Here I defined distributive monoidal categories and cartesian distributive categories. Distributive categories are categorification of distributive lattices. This PR proves that every closed monoidal category is distributive so in particular every topos is cartesian distributive. An interesting example of a distributive monoidal category which is not cartesian distributive is the category of pointed types -- perhaps we can see this as a monoidal analogue of topos. This PR also proves that every preadditive monoidal category with binary coporducts is distributive, e.g. abelian groups, R-modules, and vector bundles.</p>\n<p>TODO: The category of topological spaces and affine schemes are examples of distributive categories (which are neither closed monoidal category nor preadditive monoidal). If you're interested to work on this, feel free to do so, since I'm going to work on other aspects of dist categories. </p>\n<p>I have <strong>two questions:</strong> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I want to construct the extensive completion of distributive categories. What is a natural place for this in mathlib? As a separate file in the directory Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Distributive or should I add it to the file Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Extensive.lean?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think the PR is ready to merge, but currently at the end of my PR, i get <code>messageFile.md</code> from the github-actions bot and i've never encountered this message. What is this about?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
