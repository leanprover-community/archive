I made it scoped in <code>AddMonoidAlgebra</code> and did <em>not</em> introduce it for <code>MonoidAlgebra</code>.</p>\n<p>I only used the notation for single-character <code>R</code> and <code>A</code>s and only in the range <code>[a-zA-Z]</code>.  The remaining cases could be added, but are very few in any case.</p>",
