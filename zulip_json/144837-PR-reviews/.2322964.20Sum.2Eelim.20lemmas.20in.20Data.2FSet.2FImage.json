What's mathlib policy here, do we keep both versions?</p>\n<p>In the particular setting of the lemma, there is a somewhat canonical* statement (which puts <code>inl</code> before <code>inr</code>, as opposed to the other way round), so one could argue for keeping only one of these.</p>\n<p>\\* at least in cultures used to reading/writing left-to-right... given that we're communicating in English, perhaps this assumption is fine?</p>",
