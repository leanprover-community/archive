In <a href=\"https://github.com/Vilin97/forward_euler\">https://github.com/Vilin97/forward_euler</a> I defined it and proved that it converges to the true solution as the time step shrinks. I used a strong assumption that the RHS of the ODE is globally bounded -- it can be relaxed with some extra work but I first want to understand if there is interest in this kind of work.</p>\n<p>I split the formalization into two PRs. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/35753\">One</a> has nothing to do with the Euler method, and is just about regular grids and linear interpolation. The <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/35755\">second PR</a> is about the forward Euler method specifically.</p>\n<p>For transparency, this is my first time making heavy use of Claude Code for a mathlib PR.  The initial version of the formalization was done by Aristotle, and then I went through many (20+) iterations of factoring out lemmas, golfing, simplifying proofs using Claude Code. I do believe that the final code is reasonably high quality -- probably higher than if I was writing it myself. The initial formalization took Aristotle 2 hours, and I spent ~12 hours iterating on it with Claude Code.</p>",
