I was a little concerned that this would make some computations using <code>Circle</code> lengthier, e.g. in Fourier transform computations; but looking at the PR, that evidently isn't the case – a lot of <code>Submonoid.coe_smul</code>'s have become <code>Circle.coe_smul</code>, but that is a small net gain, rather than a loss. (I left one very minor remark.)</p>",
