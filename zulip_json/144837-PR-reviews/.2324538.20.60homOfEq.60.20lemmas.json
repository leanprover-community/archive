Specifically, I have lemmas converting<code>HEq (homOfEq f _ _) g</code> into <code>HEq f g</code>, even in cases where the alternative of converting into <code>homOfEq f _ _ = g</code> is type-correct, on the principle that the former makes progress and the latter does not. Certainly that was true in my original use case.</p>",
