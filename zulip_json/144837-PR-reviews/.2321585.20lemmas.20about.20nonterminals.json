I think this sort of material is an excellent candidate for an official \"child of Mathlib\" repository (i.e. same standards as mathlib, <code>leanprover-community</code> organization, independent maintainer team, still oversight by the Mathlib admin team). I'd love to see the people working on computability hash this out!</p>",
