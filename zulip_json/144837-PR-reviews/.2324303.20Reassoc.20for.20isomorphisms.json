This PR lets us tag <code>[reassoc]</code> lemmas that are about isomorphisms, and use <code>reassoc_of%</code>for isomorphisms.<br>\nThis feature requested by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"459699\">@Joël Riou</span> is still awaiting a (meta) reviewer. Assigned reviewer preferred leaving review to someone else. The code is mostly a copy-paste-with-slight-modifications of the original reassoc attribute code.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Kim Morrison</span> can you maybe have a look at this? Given that you wrote reassoc (as well as being both a tactics and category theory maintainer) you’re probably the best suited to review this?</p>",
