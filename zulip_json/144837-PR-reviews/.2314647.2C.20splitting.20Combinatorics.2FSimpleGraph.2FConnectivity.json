The first part of <code>Connectivity</code> certainly splits off nicely...<br>\nI wonder if having one file with the basic definitions first is nice (e.g., <code>Connectivity/Defs.lean</code>, which could define Walk, Path, Trail etc.). Then <code>Walk.lean</code> could show basic properties of walks... that part seems long enough, so perhaps walk counting could be yet another different file.</p>\n<p>I made a start in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/MR-split-combinatorics-graphs-harder\">branch#MR-split-combinatorics-graphs-harder</a>, but probably won't have time to pursue this further.
