The main result is that a finite product of probability measures depends continuously on the factors. It is essentially the same argument as for the binary product, which is already in mathlib. This is motivated by PFR, where I have used a particular case of this result (in the case of finite spaces) that I'd like to replace by the general result.</p>",
