I'm a new contributor — I've opened <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/35467\">#35467</a>, which adds Schreier graphs, Cayley graphs, and Cayley sum graphs to Mathlib.</p>\n<p>The PR takes a quiver-based approach (building on the Lean 3 PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3/pull/18693\">leanprover-community/mathlib3#18693</a>) to get directed, edge-labeled graphs with covering maps, connectivity, and vertex-transitivity. It also includes Cayley sum graphs as a separate SimpleGraph construction for additive combinatorics.</p>\n<p>This complements Edward's <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/35084\">#35084</a>, which generalizes circulantGraph to mulCayley/addCayley on the SimpleGraph side.</p>\n<p>I'd really appreciate any review or feedback — happy to split the PR or restructure if that helps.<br>\nThanks!</p>",

I'm sorry about this. Those two references are fake — they were AI-generated and I failed to verify them before submitting. That's entirely my fault.</p>\n<p>To answer your questions directly: yes, I used AI extensively in writing this PR, including the docstrings where those references appeared. The PR description was also AI-assisted. The statement “The code has been reviewed by the author and their advisor.” was written by me and is accurate — my advisor and I did review the code together — but neither of us checked the references and docstrings carefully enough.</p>\n<p>I'm removing the fake references now and will carefully audit the rest of the PR for any other issues I missed.</p>",
