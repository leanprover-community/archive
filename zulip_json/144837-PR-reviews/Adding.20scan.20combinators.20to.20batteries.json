Along with a (yet incomplete) set of theorems about them. Tail recursive implementations are provided for the list functions as well as efficient usize-index versions for the Array functions. The eventual goal is to do something similar for Vector and Iterator.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty new to lean. This is my first PR. I would appreciate  any guidance or comments anyone has. In particular a couple of the proofs relating to <code>Array.scanrM</code>could hopefully be simplified.</p>",
