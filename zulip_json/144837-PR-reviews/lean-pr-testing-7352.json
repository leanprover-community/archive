As these places are unused elsewhere, and have not received any attention for a while, for now I am simply <strong>commenting them out</strong>, leaving an adaptation note in place. Search for <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7352\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7352</a> to find these.</p>\n<p>Contributors are very welcome to restore these facts by fixing them. Please insert <code>Id.run</code> wherever needed to convert from <code>Id α</code> to <code>α</code> </p>\n<p>You can push changes directly to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/lean-pr-testing-7352\">branch#lean-pr-testing-7352</a> for now.</p>",
