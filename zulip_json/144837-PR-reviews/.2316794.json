Either flip the order of these two files, or just split your new results out into a separate file?</p>",

That feels a bit weird, but I guess this is because we can’t simply do \"oh look, this actually generalizes a concept we defined way earlier, let’s pretend we’ve been working with that from the beginning\" in Lean, so that forces an unintuitive import tree.</p>",
