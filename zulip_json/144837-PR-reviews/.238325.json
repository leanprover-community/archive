I found <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=tsum_eq_tsum_of_hasSum_iff_hasSum#doc\">docs#tsum_eq_tsum_of_hasSum_iff_hasSum</a> which is quite convenient! Since that lemma exists, maybe we can state all such results in the form of \"HasSum iff HasSum\", which doesn't require the T2Space assumption, and it would be easy to convert to \"tsum eq tsum\" when necessary.</p>",
