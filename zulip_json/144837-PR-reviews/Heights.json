It also adds <code>positivity</code> extensions for the various kinds of heights and adds a few API lemmas for products on <code>Multiset</code>s and on <code>finprod</code>s. One of these leads to a significant import increase in Mathlib/Algebra/BigOperators/Finprod.lean (it is not a <code>public import</code>, however). The alternative would be to put <code>finprod_le_finprod</code> into a new file (<code>#find_home!</code> didn't find a good place for it). This can be discussed in the PR comments.</p>",
