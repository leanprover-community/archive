The usual notation is never <code>t₁ ≤ t₂</code>. Where do you see that on this wikipedia page? This page very clearly says that people can't decide what is the order relation and use both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let me note that mathlib has the (un-namespaced!) <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/tmp_order\">docs#tmp_order</a> on topologies which is the subset order but not an instance. However, it's a local instance for a part of the file, so some lemma like <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/tmp_order\">docs#tmp_order</a> gets the subset order instance rather than the default superset order, which can be confusing.</p>\n<p>I'd advocate to adopt the subset order everywhere, as I think the reason for not doing so are not good enough, even though I agree with the order on filters. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"268315\">@Anatole Dedecker</span> pointed out two monotonicities (like <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/le_of_nhds_le_nhds\">docs#le_of_nhds_le_nhds</a>) that would become antitonic for the subset order, but it's not as strong a reason IMO as in the case of filters, where the viewpoint that filters are generalized subsets imposes the superset order.</p>",

I've never seen <code>≤</code> used in this context so there is no trouble at all, and our convention simply works better for the way we do topology in mathlib, which is very suitable for formalization and does not exist on paper as far as we know.  Maybe we could redefine <code>topological_space X</code> to be a function from <code>X</code> to <code>filter X</code> satisfying the appropriate axiom so that you find the ordering more natural but I don't have time for this. The ordering we use are already fully consistent from filter to uniform spaces through topologies. I really don't see the point of inverting one order relation in the middle of this chain.</p>",
