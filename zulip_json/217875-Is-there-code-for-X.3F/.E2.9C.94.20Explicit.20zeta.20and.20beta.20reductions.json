Is it possible to change the goal by substituting the definition of g (doing a zeta reduction)? The only way I see how to do this is by calling 'simp only [g],' but I'd hope that it wouldn't be necessary to invoke the simplifier, both since it seems more costly and since it might do some additional simplification. <br>\nThe same question came up for beta reduction: Suppose that 'f' is a function, and that my goal involves '(λ x, f x) y'. What is the best way to explicitly modify this term to f y in the goal?</p>",
