The problem is that the proof term is rather ugly because <code>e</code> and <code>e'</code> can be long chains of sums.<br>\n(I'm helping out <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321459\">@Damiano Testa</span> on his tactic to order sums of monomials).</p>\n<p>So, the question is: how can I build such a proof term expression? The proof in tactic mode can be done with <code>simp only [add_comm, add_assoc, add_left_comm]</code></p>",
