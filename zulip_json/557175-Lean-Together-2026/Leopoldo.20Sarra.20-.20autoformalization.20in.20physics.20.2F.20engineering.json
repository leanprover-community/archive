We are currently iterating on the quantum library as a proof of concept to try more practical applications, it's more about understanding how hard is it to build the supporting tactics and interfaces rather than the specific field I would say!</p>",

I do recall someone working on affine connections which I hope will one day meet with my attempts on top down Ehresmann connections (specialised to principal fiber bundles).</p>\n<p>The first two of Maxwell's equations (no magnetic monopoles and Faraday's law) are a consequence of the first Bianchi identity. But I feel we are still some way from being to write that down (and certainly without the \"Débauche d'indices\" as Cartan puts it). But it would be fun to do this Mathlib or PhysLean.</p>",

I'm fully aware that it probably feels that PhysLean is my fiefdom, and I am willing to take suggestions of how we can prevent/mitigate this. Here is my suggestion: We expand/create the 'maintainer team' for the project, and then if you have someone on your team who 1) is somewhat use to Mathlib's review process, 2) has direct experience writing Lean code for physics, 3) willing to volunteer to be on the 'maintainer team' and act impartially and independently, then I think it makes sense to have them on the 'maintainer team'. </p>\n<p>Is this an approach you think you would be interested in?</p>",
