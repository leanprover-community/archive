As an organiser of LT2025 I know how much hard work it is, and even though it's over for the participants, the authors still have to top and tail and upload all the videos (and I'm sure I'm not the only person who had to miss at least one talk because of teaching commitments so will be eagerly waiting for this!). </p>\n<p>Thanks again to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"350992\">@Rémy Degenne</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"260921\">@Markus Himmel</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197836\">@Jireh Loreaux</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> !</p>",
