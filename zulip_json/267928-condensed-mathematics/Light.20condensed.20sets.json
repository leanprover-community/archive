It depends on quite a few other PRs, but comments and suggestions are very welcome! </p>\n<p>The problem with defining sheaves on large sites is that you need a universe bump to be able to sheafify. This is a priori still true for large essentially small categories in Lean, so we still need to do some work with transferring sheaves over equivalences of the defining sites to actually get a small sheaf when we sheafify.</p>",
