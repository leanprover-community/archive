I feel like I'm still too much of a beginner to contribute here. Right now as a toy example for learning purposes, I'm trying to formalize the single-qutrit Pauli and Clifford groups. Maybe later once I know a bit more I can also try to contribute something here.</p>",

(Here \"I\" would actually be <code>1</code> in Lean.)</li>\n<li>The eigenvalues of <code>A ⊗ₖ B</code> are the products of the eigenvalues of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.
