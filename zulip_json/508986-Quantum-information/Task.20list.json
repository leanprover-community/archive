I thought I would try to list some here, as they come to me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show that the <a href=\"https://github.com/Timeroot/Lean-QuantumInfo/blob/d3b900e1127d246b88aa85bc16fef6e364816c7e/QuantumInfo/Finite/CPTPMap/CPTP.lean#L161\">replacement channel</a> is completely positive.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Timeroot/Lean-QuantumInfo/blob/d3b900e1127d246b88aa85bc16fef6e364816c7e/QuantumInfo/Finite/Capacity.lean#L137\">Showing that capacity</a> of the identity channel is (at least) <code>log(D)</code></li>\n<li>Defining \"partial trace\" <a href=\"https://github.com/Timeroot/Lean-QuantumInfo/blob/d3b900e1127d246b88aa85bc16fef6e364816c7e/QuantumInfo/Finite/CPTPMap/CPTP.lean#L230\">as a CPTP map</a>. There's already <code>Matrix.traceLeft</code>, but there needs to be the fact that it's linear, and probably also a <code>HermitianMat.traceLeft</code> would be good.</li>\n<li>There are several sorries about <a href=\"https://github.com/Timeroot/Lean-QuantumInfo/blob/main/QuantumInfo/Finite/POVM.lean\">POVM</a>'s; they are not fleshed out very well.</li>\n<li>It would also be great to have the notion of \"the two-element POVM defined by one operator T, with 0 &lt;= T &lt;= 1\", and lemmas/theorems about it. I'm thinking something like <code>def POVM₂ (T : HermitianMat d) : POVM Bool d := ... </code>.</li>\n<li>Right now most of the repo is very focused on arbitrary finite dimensions, but of course there's a lot of qubit-specific stuff to be said. Building out <a href=\"https://github.com/Timeroot/Lean-QuantumInfo/blob/main/QuantumInfo/Finite/Qubit/Basic.lean\">Qubit/Basic.lean</a> with some facts like \"what is the Pauli group\" / \"what is the Clifford group\", or some basic equations (\"H * Z * H = X\") would be great. Even better if done for arbitrary qudits where possible. :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's also the (somewhat out of date?) stuff in <a href=\"https://github.com/Timeroot/Lean-QuantumInfo/blob/main/TODO.md\">TODO.md</a>. That tries to align material to Mark Wilde's textbook, which is available as a pdf <a href=\"https://markwilde.com/qit-notes.pdf\">here</a>.</p>",
