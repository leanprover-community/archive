It seems like a formal verification of AC semantics would be useful for categorical quantum circuits, and I think there is now a Lean software for string diagrams? I might be naive, but mathlib seems to have a lot of category theory to work with. Has anyone thought about this/explored this? Even just formalizing dagger closed compact categories would be interesting. I'd love to do this down the line as I get better at Lean4.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
