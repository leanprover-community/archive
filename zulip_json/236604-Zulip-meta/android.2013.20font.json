Also all of your apps would be a few megabytes larger, look slightly different from each other, and be missing support for different language scripts considered unimportant by their developers, all for no good reason. Text rendering is one of the core responsibilities of an operating system, as it should be; this model has worked for millions of people running thousands of apps for dozens of years. So the conclusion I would draw is that it’s unwise to rely on a phone from a manufacturer who breaks text rendering just to look different.</p>\n<p>If you want to help other users with affected phones, I recommend trying to reproduce the issue in other apps, to establish that it’s not just one app doing something funny (which I’m pretty confident it’s not), then file an issue with Motorola support.</p>",
