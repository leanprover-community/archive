Also all of your apps would be a few megabytes larger, look slightly different from each other, and be missing support for different language scripts considered unimportant by their developers, all for no good reason. Text rendering is one of the core responsibilities of an operating system, as it should be; this model has worked for millions of people running thousands of apps for dozens of years.
