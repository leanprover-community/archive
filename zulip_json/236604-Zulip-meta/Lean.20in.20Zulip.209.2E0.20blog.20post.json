We wish them the best of luck!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The project will be run on the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/416277-FLT\">FLT channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/\">Lean Zulip chat</a>, a high-powered research forum where mathematicians and computer scientists can collaborate in real time, effortlessly posting code and mathematics using a thread and channel system which admirably handles the task of enabling many independent conversations to happen simultaneously.”</p>\n<p>— Kevin Buzzard, announcing The Fermat’s Last Theorem Project</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>",
