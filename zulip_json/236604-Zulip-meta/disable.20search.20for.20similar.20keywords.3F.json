I was trying to search for \"red\" and all messages containing \" 're\" (as in \"they're\"), \"read\", \"re-\" show up: I let you imagine the pleasure. Given that Lean-Zulip is aimed at a programming language where adding/subtracting a single character can make a huge difference, I wonder whether this \"sloppy\" behaviour is appropriate.</p>",

I agree though about the general behavior that it's often very annoying to do this. Double quotes works in some search engines, or back in the day <code>+</code>, but it seems neither of those work here. EDIT: It looks like Zulip uses Postgres's text search to implement this, with some dictionaries...</p>",
