When I tap on one of those streams, I get e.g. <code>#**mathlib4** </code> (note the space). I’d expect that then writing <code>&gt;N</code>, for example, might bring up the “Naming convention” topic in the mathlib4 stream, but no pop-up appears at all. Deleting the space and then typing <code>&gt;</code> doesn’t work either.</p>\n<p>Am I doing something wrong? Is there a manual workaround besides copying the link to the topic? (I’m on iOS.)</p>",
