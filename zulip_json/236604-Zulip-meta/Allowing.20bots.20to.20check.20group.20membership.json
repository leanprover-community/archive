However, it seems that the <code>GET /user_groups/&lt;id&gt;/members/&lt;user_id&gt;</code> endpoint returns <code>This endpoint does not accept bot requests.</code>.  Searching the issues on GitHub I did find <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19525\">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19525</a> with an item \"We should look at adjusting the permissions for user groups to allow bots to be members and to access them\" but it's unchecked and the issue is closed.</p>\n<p>Is the recommended workaround for now to use a user API token for those requests?</p>",
