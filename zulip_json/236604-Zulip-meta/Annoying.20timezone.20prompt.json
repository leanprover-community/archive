But this actually did nothing, since my computer's timezone (<code>America/Montreal</code>) doesn't exist in the Zulip system (so I have to resort to <code>America/New_York</code> here). This is obviously not a big deal since I can just turn it off, but it would be nice at some point to have the system in Zulip match <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/time-zones\">the IANA timezone database</a>, which is used by a lot of computers (most Linux distributions at least).</p>",
