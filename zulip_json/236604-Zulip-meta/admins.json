(I don't need/want to be one.) Given that our community is pretty active, it might be nice to have 6 ~ 8 admins, spread around the globe a bit (if possible). It's not that we need to moderate often. But if something comes up: better safe then sorry. I'll leave it to you to decide whether you want this, and which trusted members of the community you want to endow with more power (-;</p>",
