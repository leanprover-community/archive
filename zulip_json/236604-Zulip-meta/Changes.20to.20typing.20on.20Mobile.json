I can usally work around it by scrolling a bit up and down, eventually it comes into focus.</p>\n<p>For me I think it coincided with FF 132, and this release entry made that plausible:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox now uses <code>resizes-visual</code> as the default value of the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-viewport/#interactive-widget-section\"><code>interactive-widget</code></a> property of the viewport <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element. This means that when the software keyboard is shown, Firefox resizes the page's visual viewport but not its layout viewport, avoiding an expensive reflow and resulting in a more usable layout on many pages.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
