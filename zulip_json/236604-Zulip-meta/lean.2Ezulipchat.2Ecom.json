Someone I know just attempted to create an account on \"the Lean Zulip\", got a message saying that it was not possible without being invited, and then emailed me and asked if I'd invite them. I told them that an invitation was definitely not necessary, and it transpired that they had gone to <a href=\"http://lean.zulipchat.com\">lean.zulipchat.com</a> as opposed to this Zulip, which is <a href=\"http://leanprover.zulipchat.com\">leanprover.zulipchat.com</a> . Is the other Zulip instance (a) some kind of attempt to confuse people looking for the Lean Zulip (b) some genuine thing, perhaps associated to some other use of the word \"lean\" (c) a defunct attempt by our community to set up a Zulip instance (which could then perhaps be removed) or (d) something else?</p>",
