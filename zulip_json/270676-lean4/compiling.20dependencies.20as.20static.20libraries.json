So far I've been doing this by going into <code>build/lake-packages/dep/lakefile.lean</code> and adding <code>defaultFacets := ##[LeanLib.staticFacet]</code> and rebuilding in <code>build/lake-packages/dep</code> but this is super hacky and manual, and ideally i want to be able to configure this in my package's lakefile itself. Is there a more straightforward way to do this? Thanks :)</p>",
