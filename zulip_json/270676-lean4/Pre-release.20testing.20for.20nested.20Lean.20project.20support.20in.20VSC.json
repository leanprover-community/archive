I'm especially curious about any non-default Lean project setups that already worked fine previously.</p>\n<p>You can install the pre-release by navigating to the 'Extensions' side bar menu, selecting the 'Lean 4' extension and clicking the 'Switch to Pre-Release Version' button. You may also need to click 'Update' in the extension menu afterwards and restart VS Code (or just the extension host).<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/cwHYIyaI1vvw3lgkdi7asSWi/image.png\">Installing pre-releases</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/cwHYIyaI1vvw3lgkdi7asSWi/image.png\" title=\"Installing pre-releases\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1112x415\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/cwHYIyaI1vvw3lgkdi7asSWi/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>Thanks!</p>",
