It would seem not to from grepping elan's source code. Assuming I didn't miss it, does anyone else care about having it? I would want it personally because that's what I'd want my default toolchain to be outside of a project, but I have some weird personal setup (which I was just revisiting to decide if I should abandon).</p>",
