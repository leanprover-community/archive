Specifically, since we have so much more code in Lean4 now with mathlib, it's a bit hard to manage <code>_root_</code> qualified names.</p>\n<p>For example, I'm currently working with the krull dimension <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=height#doc\">docs4#height</a>, which does not live under a namespace. This means that whenever I want to create another notion of height, it must be both qualifed, and refer to the Krull height as <code>_root_.height</code> to avoid conflicts.</p>",
