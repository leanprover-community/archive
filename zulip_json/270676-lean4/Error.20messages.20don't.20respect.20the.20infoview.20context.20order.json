I think even more broadly it might be worth considering if diagnostic messages from the server should be \"as structured\" as the goal state is normally -- i.e. if the goal state wasn't \"pre-rendered\" as a string. The LSP spec does have some spots where diagnostic objects can put arbitrary structured data -- <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#diagnostic\">https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#diagnostic</a></p>",
