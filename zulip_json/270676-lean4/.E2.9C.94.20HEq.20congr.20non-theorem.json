Does that fix the theorem? </p>\n<p>Avoiding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem\">#xy</a>: In order to prove equality of two functors, I apparently need to show that two dependently-typed functions are <code>HEq</code>. I've shown that <code>∀ x, HEq (f x) (g x)</code>, but I don't see a way to turn that into <code>HEq f g</code>.</p>",
