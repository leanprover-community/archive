On cmd+C, it sometimes jumps to the documentation, or to a different file, or to a different position in the current file (sometimes I feel it's about where my mouse hovers while I press the keys). Also often the selection (not the content) just vanishes without anything being copied. I noticed it on <a href=\"https://live.lean-lang.org\">https://live.lean-lang.org</a> too, I don't know if this is due to an update of the extension or due to an update to VSCode.</p>",
