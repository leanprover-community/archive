In the past, this was a helpful sign that the proof was indeed complete, but now (especially when there are many errors),  I have to check the \"by\" line for red squiggly error lines to make sure the proof is actually done. Is there a reason this \"Goals Accomplished\" message doesn't exist?</p>",
