I was wondering whether it would be feasible to implement a theorem like base change in lean4 (the sheaves in topology version). I have been reading up on sheaves in lean4 and i feel like it would be managable but i am also not an expert in lean4 so i was wondering if someone has an idea whether this is doable or not. Thank you in advance!</p>",
