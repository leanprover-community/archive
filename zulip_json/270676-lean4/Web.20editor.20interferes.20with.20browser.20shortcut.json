I don't recall this always being the case (but I can't say I've used it a ton yet). Perhaps on windows this is also the case with Ctrl+L if someone cares to confirm. Is this behavior considered undesirable? (I honestly find it so undesirable that I'd like to check whether it's possible to never allow any website to quash a shortcut like that, but I'm also the sort of person that absolutely hates keyboard shortcuts on websites).</p>",
