I have been playing around with <code>IO.processCommandsIncrementally</code> but it seems that it only processes full commands one after the other, i.e. one declaration + implementation/proof at a time. I should have guessed given the name ^^<br>\nHowever, this doesn't exactly mirror what is happening in VS Code as tactics seem to be processed incrementally as well. Do you know the name of the incremental method behind the Lean 4 extension file processing?<br>\nThanks!</p>",
