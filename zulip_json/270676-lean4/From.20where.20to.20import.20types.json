Vector/Vec and Fin are mentioned in some of the online ressources, specifically how they are implemented and how to use them or prove something about them. </p>\n<p>But where can i find them? And more generally, how can i find types or other things in lean in general? Pointers to documentation, similar questions or general explanations would be very appreciated on my side!</p>",
