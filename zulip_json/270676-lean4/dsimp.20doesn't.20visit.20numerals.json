The reason is that <code>dsimp</code> would end up in a loop if it visited the <code>Nat</code> argument of <code>OfNat.ofNat {α : Type u} (x : Nat) [self : OfNat α x] : α</code>, because raw nat literals are refolded. But the other two arguments are perfectly valid to dsimplify. This can be implemented with a <code>dsimproc</code> (in fact the not visiting numerals is already implemented via a <code>dsimproc</code>).</p>",
