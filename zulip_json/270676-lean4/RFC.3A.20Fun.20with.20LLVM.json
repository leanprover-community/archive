However we probably do not want to teach <code>leanc</code> to link against LLVM per default because almost all Lean binaries do not actually want to do that (or might even want to link against other LLVMs instead). As I see it there are two solutions to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Just ignore it, who would want to import this file anyways</li>\n<li>Add some option to <code>lake</code> that you can enable if you want. I guess this would have to be implemented as some <code>leanc</code> flag under the hood because <code>leanc</code> should be taught where the libraries are?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does someone have an alternative approach or opinions on which one we should go for?</p>",
