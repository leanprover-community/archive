I suspect Lean would be a bad choice for most companies that deal with high-assurance software. It is simply too new, so anything that requires certification is already out, and a lot of the stuff you mentioned (cars, medical devices, rockets) deal with embedded software, which requires more control over the memory layout than Lean wants to give.</p>",

I'm not claiming that associativity wasn't proven in all characteristics before, just that it wasn't done with a single unified proof technique. This is mathematically interesting and (I believe) warrants a paper on the topic even separate from its formalization.</p>\n<p>I think improving proof techniques and unifying approaches will be one of the first mathematically salient fruits of interactive theorem proving before we get to some state where ITP actually <em>helps</em> us prove mathematically new results.</p>",
