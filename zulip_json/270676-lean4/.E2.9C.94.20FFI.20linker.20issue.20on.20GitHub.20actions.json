I tried to change the <code>lakefile.lean</code> provided in the FFI example to be more specific about the compiler (<code>g++</code>, <code>clang++</code>) and to explicitly pass additional argument (such as <code>-lstdc++</code>) but to no effect. </p>\n<p>Any suggestion as to what is going on, how to fix this, or how to investigate this further would be appreciated.</p>",
