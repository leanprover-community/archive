It may have worked ok in a number of cases so far, but every so often it goes horribly wrong (kernel heartbeat timeout, hard to debug). <br>\nAlso with the upcoming module system we really want proofs to be irrelevant, so that they can be omitted from interface files, maybe even omitted from downloaded olean etc. <br>\nSo the conclusion is that well-founded recursion should only be used when you really only care about the  classical existence of a function with that specification, and never when you want to get any kind of useful defeqs.</p>\n<p>So conversely, if you have a function that you want to have useful defeqs, then don't use well-founded recursion. One way is to use a helper definition that is built to reduce nicely, e.g. using fuel, like I did here: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7558\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7558</a></p>\n<p>This should be possible for any function that's currently defined by wf recursion with a single  Nat measure.</p>\n<p>We could even consider having a termination_by fuel … variant that uses that construction internally. </p>\n<p>(I don’t know how well this fares when reducing larger inputs, because I assume that although it won’t reduce proofs, the kernel will still construct a large proof for the fuel argument, so it may not scale to large number of recursions either.)</p>\n<p>Another alternative is not to use decide, but rewriting, when doing the proof. But I understand that our rewriting tractics (simp, rw) are not great for the use case of “do cbv normalization by rewriting” yet. I did some steps in that direction in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5977\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5977</a>, but it wasn't quite convincing yet.</p>\n<p>I agree that this is all a bit unsatisfactory until we are weaned off reducing wf proofs…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is orthogonal, but I don't actually understand why reducing defs which use wfrec needs reduction of proofs at all?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Defs using well-founded recursion use <code>WellFounded.fix</code> which is essentially structural recursion on the <code>Acc</code> predicate, and to reduce these definitions by more than one step, the proof of <code>Acc x y</code> needs to be reduce to the <code>Acc.intro</code> constructor. Depending how your well-founded definition is defined, this may involve reducing <code>Nat.le</code> or stuff like that, and can be very expensive, exponential even.</p>\n<p>You can kick the can down the road by identifying all affected functions, define them as <code>semireducible</code>, and then right afterwards use <code>attribute [irreducible] foo</code>. This gives you the old behavior and you don’t need to fix all at once.</p>\n<p>It works sometimes (for example, for technical reasons one unfolding is actually free), and when it works it’s annoyingly useful. But it shot a few legs, so we’d really like to pretend it never worked at all :-)</p>",

I changed the mathlib version, but maybe it's better to change batteries version and deduplicate the mathlib version. The changes for <code>xgcd</code> are pretty clean, without the need of private lemmas, though I do need some private def/lemma to prove my <code>strongRec'</code> reduces as expected. You could nest <code>strongRec'</code> with other recursors to work with lexicographic orders involving Nat.<br>\nMy original motivation is to make <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Nat/BinaryRec.html#Nat.binaryRec\">Nat.binaryRec</a> reducible (for exponentiation by doubling), but I realized <code>strongRec'</code> still requires linear (not logarithmic) complexity to evaluate a closed term. So this is a case where using fuel is really useful. But I wonder whether the kernel compute the fuel (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Init/Data/Nat/Log2.html#Nat.log2\">Nat.log2</a> in this case) in logarithmic time?
