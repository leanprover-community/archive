But, in some domains of mathematics, it makes sense to add or remove axioms, and formalize stuff in this new setting, and this is not necessarily about whether the theory on top of which you build the formalization is constructive or not. For instance, there is a \"theorem\" of game theory about winning strategies in infinite games which is inconsistent with the axiom of choice, but which you might want to study anyways, despite this having nothing to do with constructivism.</p>",
