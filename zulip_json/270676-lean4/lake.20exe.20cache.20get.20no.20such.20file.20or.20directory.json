Lean is installed correctly, and when running <code>lake exe cache get</code> in a project we get the error <code>no such file or directory</code>. The <code>cache.exe</code> file is correctly generated, but once it starts executing, before any message is printed, we get the aforementioned error.<br>\nThe folder <code>~/.cache</code> does not exist after running this command (so <code>leantar</code> is presumably not downloaded). He seems to have an internet connection.</p>\n<p>Any ideas? Any way to run in debug mode to print more info where it is going wrong? Can we print the path that we're trying to access?</p>\n<p>Potential issue: It is a laptop using a Japanese locale - but no unicode appears in any relevant folder.</p>",
