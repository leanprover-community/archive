However, because of the size of mathlib, there is a part of the build process involving a bash script that fails because a generated environment variable is too large (because of an OS limit). The specific error is <code>bash: Argument list too long</code>. The offending section is <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/742d053a97bdd109a41a921facd1cd6a55e89bc7/nix/buildLeanPackage.nix#L72-L80\">here</a>. I have a very small PR to fix this (a 5-line change) and I was wondering if the maintainers would be open to me submitting it. Here's the <a href=\"https://github.com/enricozb/lean4/commit/2161096f95e40637882f38104c78e96a11e34ffc\">commit itself</a> on my fork.</p>",
