Normally when I start working on a file I start with <code>import Mathlib</code> which comes in handy because I might not remember exactly which mathlib files I need to import. At the same time, when I share the code with others, depending on how <code>cache</code> works for them, they might prefer it if only the relevant files were imported. When I write haskell or rust, the vscode extension automatically adds and fixes my imports as I use names in my file. Is such a feature feasible for the vscode extension for lean?</p>",
