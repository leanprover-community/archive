This involves e.g. sending json to and from the subprocess. In order for it to have the same format, I duplicate the structures that derive <code>ToJson</code>/<code>FromJson</code>—and the types and API held by those structures—so that they appear in both the lakefile and in files for the exe defining my subprocess.</p>\n<p>This seems fragile! :) (It's also a bit inconvenient, and makes things harder to maintain; my lakefile is growing very complex.) Is there a better way, outside of doing something cursed? Am I missing a simpler approach?</p>\n<p>I would be okay with my base definitions living in a whole separate package to avoid circularity, but when I tried that, it didn't seem to work.</p>",

Currently I'm considering having a custom elaborator in my lakefile that \"pseudo-imports\" code at a filepath by essentially copying over the source and parsing/elaborating it in the lakefile. That would obviously be...a suboptimal approach, but it might help make things maintainable. <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
