        "content": "<p>This is a possibility, but we would need to use the expected type, which is not always available.<br>\nSome suggested we fall back to a default type (e.g., <code>List</code>) when the expected type is not available. However, it is not that simple. When the expected type is not immediately available, we postpone elaboration and try it again later. Moreover, some notation imposes rigid \"checkpoints\", that is, they cannot proceed until all pending elaboration sub-problems have been resolved. So, the \"fallback\" case would have to be applied at these checkpoints. <br>\nNote that we use expected-type-guided elaboration for numerals, but from time to time we hit examples where the behavior produced by the elaborator is counterintuitive, and it makes us wonder whether we should revert this decision.<br>\nThus, for very important types such as <code>List</code>, <code>Array</code>, and <code>Prod</code>, we have notations (<code>[]</code>, <code>#[]</code>, <code>()</code>) that do not depend on the expected type. Their behavior is very predictable. <br>\nIt would be interesting to try a large-scale experiment to evaluate the impact of changing these notations to expected-type-guided ones. This kind of experiment is very time-consuming but could benefit the whole community. For example, it could suggest new ways of improving the reliability of expected-type-guided elaborators.</p>",
