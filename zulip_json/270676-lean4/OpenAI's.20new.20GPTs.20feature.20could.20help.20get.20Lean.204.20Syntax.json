With the new <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts\">GPTs feature</a> you can give custom instructions and upload custom knowledge. </p>\n<p>I just uploaded the prelude and tactics from the source code with the comments removed and gave it some instructions not to use lean 3 syntax. It seems to do a lot better at generating Lean 4 syntax, although it still makes mistakes. I'm sure it could be improved further with more carefully curated code examples.</p>\n<p>If you have a ChatGPT Plus account you can try it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3QAaNV92x-lean-4-programming-assistant\">https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3QAaNV92x-lean-4-programming-assistant</a></p>\n<p>Note that I wasn't able to upload the source code directly as knowledge for the GPT, OpenAI must have a filter for detecting code files which it puts under \"code interpreter\" rather than general chat knowledge.  I got around this limitation by putting  the Lean code inside an .md file using triple backticks. This was accepted as \"knowledge\" for the GPT agent.</p>",
