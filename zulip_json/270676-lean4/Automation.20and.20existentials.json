After the <code>use</code> line, <code>solve_by_elim</code> or <code>tauto</code> (or <code>aesop</code>) can finish the proof (but <code>duper</code> cannot). How far are we from having a tactic that does the full proof? Is is in scope for <code>grind</code> for instance (I have only a very vague idea of what <code>grind</code> is meant to do when it will be ready)?</p>",
