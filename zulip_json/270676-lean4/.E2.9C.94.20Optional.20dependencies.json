I see two issues with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not everyone that wants to compiler mathlib also wants (or even can, I'm not sure whether this works under windows) compile doc-gen</li>\n<li>When mathlib wants to update its nightly they would now also have to take account doc-gen into potential breaking changes, and wait for me to fix it, that's not desirable either.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does Lake have a feature or a way to emulate something similar to Rust's dev-dependencies that can be built optionally if required? Otherwise I don't really see how to get a productive integration of doc-gen with LeanInk backlinks going that wont slow down Mathlib development speed/make me the critical path in it.</p>",
