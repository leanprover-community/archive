I can reproduce it on <code>v4.2.0</code>, but also on other versions on Mathlib. This is on Windows, does this reproduce on other machines? </p>\n<p>(1) Download mathlib and its cache<br>\n(2) Create a new file with the following contents, and wait until Lean has compiled the file</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib</span>\n<span class=\"k\">#eval</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>(3) Delete the first line all at once (e.g. with ctrl+X). On my computer this does <em>not</em> cause a recompilation of the file<br>\n(4) Type the letter <code>a</code> on the first line and wait until Lean shows an error<br>\n(5) Remove the letter <code>a</code>. The error remains. The error remains even if you start typing new commands (e.g. <code>def foo := 1</code>), and the server is interpreting as a letter <code>a</code> floating somewhere in your file. It disappears once you write <code>import</code> again.</p>\n<p>I experimented with importing less than <code>Mathlib</code>, and below a certain number of imports, this behavior seems to go away. (e.g. if we replace <code>import Mathlib</code> with <code>import Std</code>, then step 3 does cause a recompilation of the file.</p>",
