For example, if we're suggesting hypotheses, we might want to style each suggestion according to <code>.goal-hyp</code>, or if the suggestion produces an error, we might want to style it according to the appropriate <code>.error</code> style (note that the LLMStep project wants to style unparsable suggestions as error-like, so this isn't an imagined use case).</p>\n<p>The issue is that when hovering over the suggested text, the <code>a:hover</code> class (from VS code) takes precedence, and the text flashes to blue.</p>\n<p>I can hack my way around this if I need to by dynamically altering the CSS via javascript to include e.g. <code>.error:hover</code> or <code>a.error:hover</code>. But I was wondering if there'd be interest in adding these <code>:hover</code> styles to the CSS in the extension, since this is pretty easy to doâ€”or if there's  a different way this minor issue should be dealt with. :)</p>",
