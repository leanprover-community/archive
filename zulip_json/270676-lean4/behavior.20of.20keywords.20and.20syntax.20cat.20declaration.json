I recently put an issue on lean4 (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2308\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2308</a>), but I'm not convinced by the answer, here's my reasoning:</p>\n<p>In my case <code>foo</code> is a syntactic category independent of <code>term</code>, <code>ident</code> and all the other categories used in the construction of the structure (it's also work if I replace <code>syntax \" bar \" term : foo</code> by <code>syntax \" bar \" foo : foo</code>), so I don't understand why it would be desirable for the default behavior to break this independence. </p>\n<p>Is there a reason for this design (performance issue, etc.)?</p>",
