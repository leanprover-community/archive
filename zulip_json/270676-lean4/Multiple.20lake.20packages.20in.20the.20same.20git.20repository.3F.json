Some caveats here are that this would raise the required Git version for Lake to something much newer and  that Git's support for this is still not bullet-proof (see StackExchange questions like <a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/233327/is-it-possible-to-clone-only-part-of-a-git-project\">(1)</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72223463/how-to-clone-specific-folder-from-git-using-sparse\">(2)</a>).</p>",
