My proposal suggested putting the commands before the options. Further, my proposal suggested putting the most frequently used commands at the top of the list of commands.</p>\n<p>There was then a discussion in which is was suggested that it was better and/or more standard to put the most important information last due to terminal scrolling. This discussion ended in disagreement and a request for a poll to help determine the right path.</p>",

(<code>myprog</code> alone is treated as an error, if this is a command with required subcommands, which can be configured to give the short help but by default just explains the error, shows the usage line and suggests to run help.)</p>",

On Windows, <code>git &lt;command&gt; --help</code> opens all its hep text as HTML pages. <code>git &lt;command&gt; -h</code> produces command line output. <code>git --help</code> also produces CLI help and <code>git -h</code> is an error.
