I see there are lists and binary trees, but are there more rigorous ones? For example, is it possible to describe Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and argue about its computational complexity? I would be excited to discuss these with you! <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
