I understand that given the two hypotheses, it is algebraically valid to show the result. However, the result, the sum of squares of three rational numbers, can never be negative. How, then, can this be shown to be valid in Lean? I assumed that Lean's type checking machinery would catch this sort of inconsistency, but it does not. Could something like this come up in the context of a larger proof where a theorem can be proved but isn't actually consistent?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any clarification on this behavior in Lean.</p>",
