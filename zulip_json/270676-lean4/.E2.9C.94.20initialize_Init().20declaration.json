I was wondering, what is the initialize_Init function? I've tried looking for a function declaration, but I can't seem to find it, at least not initially. Is this generated in the later stages using CMake? I also think in the nightly builds its declaration is stored in the libleanshared .so file, and if it is, is there any way I can find out what else is in the .so file?</p>\n<p>If there is any additional information I need to provide, I'd be happy to help! Thanks!</p>",
