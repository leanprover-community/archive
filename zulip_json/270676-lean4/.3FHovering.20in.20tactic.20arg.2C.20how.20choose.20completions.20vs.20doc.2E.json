I have experienced that hovering sometimes produced a menu of completions, but it seemed unpredictable whether that menu or the documentation (nothing when the name was undefined) showed.   Hovering also produced documentation on the tactic or highlighting in the Infoview of what the theorem applies do.  It's very sensitive to which character position is hovered over.  I also discovered that clicking on each pane of the documentation window kept it visible until I clicked somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Where is documentation and/or a tutorial on features like this?  PS.

(Let me know if you really need a screen recording.) As I said, I couldn't tell how to get this to happen consistently.  In the screen shot, I backspaced/erased mul_assoc to mul_ ; then I typed a space; then I typed letter a--that is when the menu of completions popped up.</p>\n<p>Name: lean4<br>\nId: leanprover.lean4<br>\nDescription: Lean 4 language support for VS Code<br>\nVersion: 0.0.176<br>\nPublisher: leanprover</p>\n<p>VSCode--<br>\nVersion: 1.92.2<br>\nCommit: fee1edb8d6d72a0ddff41e5f71a671c23ed924b9<br>\nDate: 2024-08-14T17:29:30.058Z<br>\nElectron: 30.1.2<br>\nElectronBuildId: 9870757<br>\nChromium: 124.0.6367.243<br>\nNode.js: 20.14.0<br>\nV8: 12.4.254.20-electron.0<br>\nOS: Linux x64 6.8.0-40-generic</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/cN4wGCBbXTy1jDWczfOI55Yn/Screenshot-from-2024-08-27-09-29-38.png\">Screenshot-from-2024-08-27-09-29-38.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/cN4wGCBbXTy1jDWczfOI55Yn/Screenshot-from-2024-08-27-09-29-38.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2024-08-27-09-29-38.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"1872x1053\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/cN4wGCBbXTy1jDWczfOI55Yn/Screenshot-from-2024-08-27-09-29-38.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",

Up to about 3 sec after the last letter keystroke,  the completion menu appears; sometimes it appears a bit sooner or later.  Early in session, it displays a \"loading\" box for a sizable (10 sec or so) time and then displays the menu.  Then, (of course) repeating the same beginning letters makes the menu appear quickly.  When I move the pointer on and off a partially typed symbol, a box with information about the \"problem\" appears and disappears on top of the completion menu.  So this explains the design and how to use it.  But it's still handy to know that ctrl-space brings up a completion menu when the cursor is inside  partially-typed symbol.  (When I do that action, the \"loading\" box and not-too-long pause appears first, even when the same completion had been done before.)</p>\n<p>In short, I think it meets our needs well once we find out and get used to how the features interact!</p>",
