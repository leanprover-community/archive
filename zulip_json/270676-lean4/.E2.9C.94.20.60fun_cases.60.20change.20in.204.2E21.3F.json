I see from the <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/releases/v4.21.0/#release-v4___21___0\">4.21 changelog</a> that there were a few changes to <code>fun_cases</code>, but none of the things listed there seem directly the cause here.  I tried a few things but none of these change anything (even giving me a different error message):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false</code> as suggested at one point in the changelog</li>\n<li>Adding additional <code>, _</code> after <code>t₂</code> </li>\n<li>Removing <code>, t₂</code></li>\n<li>Removing case-bullets from below (starting at line 678)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyone have any idea what happened here / how to make progress?</p>",
