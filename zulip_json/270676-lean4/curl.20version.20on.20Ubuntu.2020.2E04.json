If you instead have multiple curl tasks they have to open seperate TCP connections for seperate HTTP 2 connections and each of those connections need to carry their meta data with them. Now, the meta data should (hopefully) not be too significant but I would expect that there is a measurable difference in multiple curls vs 1 curl doing multi tasking on its own assuming an HTTP 2 connection.</p>",
