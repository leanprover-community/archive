I am curious to see if I missed some docs. </p>\n<p>I am trying to write a tokenizer for lean so I want to take advantage of the parser already in lean, but right now I am just trying to see how the compiler works on a higher level. I am looking for docs like this (example from Agda): <a href=\"https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/dc3cae6d3876346f81fe4ded348192f9c7ad8c2b/notes/compiler-pipeline.md\">https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/dc3cae6d3876346f81fe4ded348192f9c7ad8c2b/notes/compiler-pipeline.md</a>.</p>",
