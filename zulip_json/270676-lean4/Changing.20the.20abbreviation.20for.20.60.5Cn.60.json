        "content": "<p>A common UX issue for pretty much anyone using Lean for programming (including long-time Lean users) is that the <code>\\n</code> abbreviation, which you type whenever you want to designate a newline, currently expands to <code>¬</code> by default. I myself get bitten by this most days when writing Lean. For programming purposes, it would be much nicer if it expanded directly to <code>\\n</code> instead.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/vscode-lean4/pull/671\">vscode-lean4#671</a> is a draft PR that proposes <code>\\n</code> to expand to <code>\\n</code> and also changes the abbreviation of <code>\\!</code> to expand to <code>¬</code>, so that there is still a single-character abbreviation for the symbol. <br>\nEven after this change, it will still be possible to set <code>\\n</code> to expand to <code>¬</code> in the <code>Lean 4 &gt; Input: Custom Translations</code> VS Code extension setting, and if desired Mathlib could even set this in its <code>settings.json</code> file for the whole project, since <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_settings-precedence\">VS Code setting objects are merged, not overridden</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I appreciate that this may be quite a controversial change of a default, as surely most people doing theorem proving with Lean have so far built muscle-memory for <code>\\n</code> to expand to <code>¬</code>, and would now have to type <code>\\no</code>, <code>\\not</code> or <code>\\!</code> instead or change the abbreviation in their VS Code settings. And on the other side of this is the currently confused muscle memory of anyone doing programming with Lean now and in the future :-)<br>\nI'd hence like to hear some thoughts on this by others. Does anyone have strong opinions on this proposed change?</p>\n<p>Some prior discussions of this: <br>\n<a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"113489\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/113489-new-members/topic/.E2.9C.94.20Unicode.20keybindings.20in.20VSCode/with/523339667\">#new members &gt; ✔ Unicode keybindings in VSCode</a> <br>\n<a class=\"message-link\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/Keep.20VS.20Code.20from.20replacing.20escape.20sequence.3F/near/269175662\">#lean4 &gt; Keep VS Code from replacing escape sequence? @ 💬</a> <br>\n(I'm sure there were other discussions in the past, but I can't find them because Zulip doesn't allow searching for <code>\\n</code> or <code>¬</code>, unfortunately)</p>",

But I wonder if there's another solution here, such as a shortcut to easily and temporarily disable abbreviations. My reasoning for this is that similar issues to <code>\\n</code>occur when writing latex for mathlib docs or for latex or html in verso, and changing all abbrevs like this seems hard to scale and more disruptive.</p>",

I can see that this might be more useful in the context of writing LaTeX docs for other abbreviations, though, so please create a GitHub issue in the vscode-lean4 repo for it :-)</p>",
