Someone submits a PR claiming that they defined xyz without using any sorry terms. How can I verify this through the command line? Is there some  command line argument by which I can use test if a term is defined without depending on any sorry? This would help because I could automatically test PRs that claim to create a definition for xyz, in order to check that they actually do</p>\n<p>Best, <br>\nVatsa</p>",
