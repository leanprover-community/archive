But for a local installation with a repo depending on mathlib you still need a command line as far as I can see. It looks to me like this is now a job the lean 4 extension could do, because the only missing step is <code>lake exe cache get</code>. Is it worth opening an issue for this? I worry about these web-based solutions for longer-term courses such as the one I teach Jan-Mar to final year students; I fear that somehow something will time out and they'll lose all their work.</p>",
