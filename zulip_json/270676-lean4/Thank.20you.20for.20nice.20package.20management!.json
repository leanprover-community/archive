When fiddling around with the Mandelbrot set these days I've split the related code into 5 different repos, and it's quite pleasant to keep them synced, update some but not others if there are temporary incompatibilities, moving code around and re-sync in stages if that's easiest. I originally split <a href=\"https://github.com/girving/interval\">interval</a> out of <a href=\"https://github.com/girving/ray\">ray</a> when someone asked if they could use it standalone, then later I split out the interval-using parts of ray into a <a href=\"https://github.com/girving/ray-render\">ray-render</a> repo so that I can sync the mathematical parts without syncing the computational parts, and now there are two more (<a href=\"https://github.com/girving/series\">series</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/girving/bottcher\">bottcher</a>), and jumping around between all of these remains very pleasant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/r7ZPGFGyn3WgKQ0U2RBlwJ_9/Screenshot-2025-11-12-at-11.17.24PM.png\">Screenshot 2025-11-12 at 11.17.24 PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/r7ZPGFGyn3WgKQ0U2RBlwJ_9/Screenshot-2025-11-12-at-11.17.24PM.png\" title=\"Screenshot 2025-11-12 at 11.17.24 PM.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"728x824\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/r7ZPGFGyn3WgKQ0U2RBlwJ_9/Screenshot-2025-11-12-at-11.17.24PM.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
