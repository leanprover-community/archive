It's based on <code>lsp-mode</code>, which is generally very nice, but sadly <a href=\"https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/2080\">doesn't compute character positions correctly</a>, so that it crashes when editing files that contain characters outside the Unicode BMP, like ùìù (<code>\\nhds</code>).</p>\n<p>If these things don't get fixed it's no surprise that the Emacs mode doesn't have too many users. But it does have some users!</p>\n<p>To do the Topology chapter of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span>'s <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/\">#mil</a>, I switched briefly to VS Code, but I didn't enjoy it. Hence my <a href=\"https://github.com/bustercopley/lean4-mode/settings\">Eglot fork of lean4-mode</a>. As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"266304\">@Siddhartha Gadgil</span> implies, when you make the choice to use Emacs, you generally accept that fixing Emacs is your job now! <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
