In \"Introduction\" we have a preliminary section on history, and then we see our first line of Lean code, powered by Verso, in <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest//Introduction/#code-samples\"><code>1.2.1. Lean Code</code></a> and it's <code>def hello : IO Unit := ...</code>. I hover over <code>Unit</code> and get a lovely docstring; I hover over <code>IO</code> and it just says <code>IO : Type → Type</code>. This might be the first Lean code that people ever see (if they stumble on the language via the reference manual) -- isn't this good motivation to just slap a quick docstring on <code>IO</code> and <code>IO.println</code>, the other function which we get to see in action in this very first line of code in the book? I would make a PR myself but I don't have the first clue what <code>IO</code> is (other than \"it's a monad and has something to do with programming\") (but I would maybe know more if there were a docstring!).</p>",
