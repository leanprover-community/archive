It provides <code>tr!\"\"</code> strings that are monad-valued, and they read the current value of the <code>lang</code> option. When compiling, the system checks to see if there are translations for every declared language, and if there are not it suggests a new <code>@[translation]</code> definition to add to the environment. This system expects all translations of all keys to exist ahead of their use.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of usage:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib.I18n.Basic</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">decl_lang</span> <span class=\"n\">fr</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"français\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">@[</span><span class=\"n\">translation</span> <span class=\"n\">fr</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Expecting an identifier, not {1}\"</span><span class=\"kd\">]</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">tr1</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">String</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">String</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">s</span><span class=\"bp\">!</span><span class=\"s2\">\"attendu : un identifiant, pas {x}\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">elab</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"foo\"</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">tactic</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">throwError</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">tr</span><span class=\"bp\">!</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Expecting an identifier, not {x.getNat}\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- Expecting an identifier, not 1</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">set_option</span> <span class=\"n\">lang</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"fr\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- attendu : un identifiant, pas 1</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">elab</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"foo2\"</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">tactic</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">throwError</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">tr</span><span class=\"bp\">!</span><span class=\"s2\">\"unknown error\"</span>\n<span class=\"c\">/-</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">Warning: Missing translation for fr (français) with key \"unknown error\".</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">Template:</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">@[translation fr \"unknown error\"]</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">def tr : String :=</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">  s!\"unknown error\"</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">-/</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">elab</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"foo3\"</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">tactic</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">throwError</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">tr</span><span class=\"bp\">!</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The following are not equal: {1} and {2}\"</span>\n<span class=\"c\">/-</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">Missing translation for fr (français) with key \"The following are not equal:{1} and {2}\".</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">Template:</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">@[translation fr \"The following are not equal:{1} and {2}\"]</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">def tr (s_1 : String) (s_2 : String) : String :=</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">  s! \"The following are not equal: {s_1 } and {s_2}\"</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">-/</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
