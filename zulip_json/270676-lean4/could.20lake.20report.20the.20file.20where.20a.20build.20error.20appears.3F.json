(The file name is <code>LoVe10_</code>, oops, but spelled correctly in other places.) It would be super helpful if <code>lake</code> could report which file the error appears in. Is this feasible? And if I should open an issue, is it more appropriate for <code>lake</code> or <code>lean4</code>?</p>",
