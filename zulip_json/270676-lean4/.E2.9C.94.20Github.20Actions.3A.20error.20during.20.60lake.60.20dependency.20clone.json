I have tried <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node/issues/214#issuecomment-810829250\">this workaround</a> for a similar issue regarding cloning NPM repos from CI (<a href=\"https://github.com/Deducteam/lean2dk/blob/f9a31e0cb3b1dd3e041f0ee289a33940f08ae271/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L21\">see here</a>), but as you can see it hasn't worked out for me. Is it possible to directly instruct <code>lake</code> to use an HTTP URL instead, or is there another way around this? I may also try <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node/issues/214#issuecomment-742596196\">this more involved workaround</a> if no one has any ideas.</p>",
