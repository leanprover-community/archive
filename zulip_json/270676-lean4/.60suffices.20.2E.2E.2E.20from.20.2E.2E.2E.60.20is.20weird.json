I ask to gpt4 want to get some conviction, but what it gives me make me more misunderstanding. Can anyone convince me the choice of <code>suffices ... from ...</code>?</p>\n<p>The following is taken from gpt4, what it said is not the Lean4 intended:</p>\n<p>Q: Please tell me why Lean4 chose the syntax <code>suffices ... from ...</code>, try to convince me by logic and English grammar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A: Lean4, like many other theorem provers and proof assistants, uses syntax inspired by mathematical vernacular and logic. While it might not strictly follow the rules of English grammar, it attempts to create a balance between readability and formalism.</p>\n<p>The syntax <code>suffices ... from ...</code> is designed to reflect the logical structure of the argument. The word \"suffices\" is used to express that a certain statement is a sufficient condition for proving the goal. The keyword \"from\" is used to show where the evidence for the sufficient condition comes from, i.e., the origin of the proof.</p>\n<p>In terms of logic, the suffices tactic helps to break down a complex proof into smaller, more manageable steps. When you use suffices x from y, you are essentially saying that proving x is enough (suffices) to prove the current goal, and that you will prove x using y.</p>\n<p>As for English grammar, the word \"suffices\" is the third person singular form of the verb \"suffice.\" In this context, it means that something is enough or adequate for a particular purpose. The preposition \"from\" is used to indicate the source or origin of something. So, when you say \"suffices x from y\" in Lean4, you are expressing that proving x is enough to achieve the goal, and the proof of x originates from y.</p>\n<p>Although the syntax might not align perfectly with standard English grammar, it effectively communicates the logical structure and intent of the proof step. This choice of syntax is a trade-off between readability and formalism, which aims to make the language expressive and efficient for its purpose: proving mathematical statements.</p>\n</blockquote>",
