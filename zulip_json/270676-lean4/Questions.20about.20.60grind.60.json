What happened in the v4.29.0-rc1 bump that necessitated such a change?<br>\n(2) In my attempt at avoiding doing a painful proof, I went to the pre-bump version and tried to use <code>grind?</code> to find out which lemmas were actually used by each <code>grind</code>.  But I found out that once I added the <code>?</code>, the <code>grind</code> proof blows up (in the sense of exceeding <code>maxHeartbeats</code>).  Even after 5x <code>maxHeartbeats</code>, the <code>grind?</code>still could not solve the goal.  Why?</p>",
