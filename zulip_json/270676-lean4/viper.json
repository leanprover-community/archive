I built it because I got tired of</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>$ which python\n$ which python3\n$ which pip\n$ which pip3\n$ conda activate\n$ conda deactivate\n$ python blah\n$ pip bleh\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Instead, <code>viper</code> centralizes everything with an unified API.<br>\nThanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321696\">@Julian Berman</span> for the <code>venvs</code> idea and for the guidance on child processes!</p>",

I've been consistently using it for more than 3 years now.</p>\n<p>I've just updated it to v4.24.0. If you also do Python development and use multiple environments like I do, you might want to give <code>viper</code> a try. The link is on the post above.</p>\n<p>Peace <span aria-label=\"pray\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"pray\">:pray:</span></p>",
