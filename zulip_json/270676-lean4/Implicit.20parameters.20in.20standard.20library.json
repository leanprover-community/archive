The current convention seems to opt for more implicit parameters while older theorems often use less implicits but in general the use of implicits vs explicits is inconsistent across the codebase. Also, the issue of implicit parameters recently came up as <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8244\">lean4#8244</a>. Ideally, we should get a consensus on how to approach implicits and then put it into the standard library docs.</p>",
