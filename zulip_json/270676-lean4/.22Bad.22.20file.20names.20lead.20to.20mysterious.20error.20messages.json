The jist there is that this is actually a parser error which Lake never sees (i.e., it ends up thinking you wrote the perfectly fine <code>import Foo.main</code> due to how the Lean import parser works, and the error Lake actually encounters is a real build cycle). I sketched a potential solution for this, but had not yet had the time to implement it (as it was not clear this was a high priority issue at the time).</p>",
