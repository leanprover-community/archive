If the proof is <code>by simp</code>, doesn't this mean that <code>simp</code> can already prove whatever is being added as a simp lemma? This seems to occur... 27 times in mathlib, so I presume it does something. Does it somehow teach the simplifier which route to take when simplifying (i.e. provide some performance benefit)? Or does this really teach <code>simp</code> to do something it couldn't otherwise?</p>",
