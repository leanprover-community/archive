However, no matter what I try (updating the option of the linter, tracing a message, reading past errors,...) seems doomed to fail.</p>\n<p>Is this something that linters are forbidden from doing?  E.g. suppose that I wanted a linter that simply counted the number of commands on which it ran in the current file.  Is that possible?  How?</p>",
