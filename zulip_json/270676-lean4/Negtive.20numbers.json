I recently tried to evaluate the expression 0 - 1 = 0, but to my surprise, the result was true. I am wondering if there is something that I am doing wrong, or if this is a known issue in Lean 4. I have attached my code below.

THe alternative would be to force you to proof that whenever you do <code>Nat.sub n m</code> <code>m &lt; n</code>. But that just makes many things tedious since the majority of uses of <code>Nat.sub</code> already implicitly do stuff like this. Providing a garbage value instead of limiting the domain of a function is a very common thing that other ITPs like Coq also do.</p>",
