The Lean runtime does not have a thread primitive. Instead it deals in tasks that get run as multi threaded as possible by the runtime. So what you have to do is limit the threads that the runtime can use. This in turn can be easily done by setting the environment variable <code>LEAN_NUM_THREADS</code></p>",
