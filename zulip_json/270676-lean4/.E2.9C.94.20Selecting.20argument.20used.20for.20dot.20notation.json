By default, if <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are <code>Nat</code>s, <code>m.f n = f m n</code>. Is there a way to configure things such that intead the second argument is used for the dot notation, i.e. <code>m.f n = f n m</code>? I see from searching that such a change was considered in the past, but I'm not sure if this is a current feature yet.</p>",
