I think the reaction of most newcomers trying to understand the code is that they cannot read these definitions anywhere. At least this was my reaction at first and I know I'm not the only one.</p>\n<p>There is this comment:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c\">/-</span><span class=\"cm\">! WARNING: The following 4 constants are a hack for simulating forward declarations.</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">   They are defined later using the `export` attribute. This is hackish because we</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">   have to hard-code the true arity of these definitions here, and make sure the C names match.</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">   We have used another hack based on `IO.Ref`s in the past, it was safer but less efficient. -/</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I would much prefer it if the comment explicitly mentions the names <code>whnfImp</code>, <code>inferTypeImp</code>, <code>isExprDefEqAuxImpl</code>, <code>isLevelDefEqAuxImpl</code>.</p>",
