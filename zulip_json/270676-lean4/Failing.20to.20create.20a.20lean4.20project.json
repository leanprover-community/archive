        "content": "<p>Hi, so as usual whenever I try to update mathlib or create a new Lean project, I feel like a total idiot because I fail. This time I tried to follow the instructions there:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Using-mathlib4-as-a-dependency\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Using-mathlib4-as-a-dependency</a><br>\nFirst I updated elan, I have version 2.0.1 now, at least that's what <code>elan -V</code> says.<br>\nThen I ran <code>lake +leanprover-community/mathlib4:lean-toolchain new ShinyProject math</code> as instructed, moved to the project folder and tried running <code>lake exe cache get</code> (again as instructed). It tells me <br>\n<code>error: dependency 'mathlib' of 'AbstractSimplicialComplex' not in manifest, use `lake update` to update</code><br>\nWell, no problem, I can run <code>lake update</code>.  It happily clones a bunch of stuff. Then I try running <code>lake exe cache get</code> and the trouble starts. It downloads 3720 files and panics, as in:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"decompressing\"><pre><span></span><code>thread '&lt;unnamed&gt;' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: UnexpectedEof, message: \"failed to fill whole buffer\" }', /project/src/ltar.rs:57:34\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\nthread '&lt;unnamed&gt;' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: UnexpectedEof, message: \"failed to fill whole buffer\" }', /project/src/ltar.rs:57:34\nthread '&lt;unnamed&gt;' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: UnexpectedEof, message: \"failed to fill whole buffer\" }', /project/src/ltar.rs:57:34\nthread '&lt;unnamed&gt;' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: UnexpectedEof, message: \"failed to fill whole buffer\" }', /project/src/ltar.rs:57:34\nthread '&lt;unnamed&gt;' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: UnexpectedEof, message: \"failed to fill whole buffer\" }', /project/src/ltar.rs:57:34\nuncaught exception: leantar failed with error code 101\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If I now try to work on lean file inside the project, the lean server refuses to start. (I can send that error message if it helps.)</p>\n<p>So what did I screw up this time ? (Last time I wanted to update mathlib so I could do categories stuff, I never succeeded and ended up creating a new project instead, but at least I was able to create the new project...)</p>",

It will update your project to the latest version of mathlib. You should not use <code>lake update</code> in mathlib itself though (unless you are a maintainer), as it will update mathlib's dependencies, causing the cache to miss and possibly causing mathlib not to build</p>",

The rust panic message quoted above has been fixed in leantar master, although I haven't released a new version. (This message is complaining that the file was truncated due to an aborted download, and the new version makes this error message clearer.) The rename issue has not yet been fixed but should be relatively simple</p>",
