The space kills it for me; I feel like the syntax <em>does</em> (should) look like a normal command (e.g. <code>def</code>) followed by special brackets to isolate the attribute. For me, it’s that when using <code>@[]</code>, the whole thing does sort of feel like it constitutes “special brackets” to <em>some</em> degree (see above for caveats), and more importantly, looks clearer visually (which I feel would not necessarily be the case with recoloring <code>attribute</code>).
