I have discussed this with a few people and the there has not been a clear answer on which of <code>_lake</code> or <code>.lake</code> is the better. <code>.lake</code> would make it a hidden directory on Unix operating systems while <code>_lake</code> would not be, and it is not clear whether or not this is desirable.
