But not with LEAN yet obviously.</p>\n<p>Hope you can help, and maybe interested in taking this on as a project. I am looking at a one off printers, but this might be a good project for looking at getting a larger print run and publishing done ?</p>\n<p>Many thanks in advance,</p>\n<p>Aaron Gray</p>",
