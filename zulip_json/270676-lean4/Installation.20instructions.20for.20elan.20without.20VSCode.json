All this does is cause VSCode to run the command</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>bash<span class=\"w\"> </span>-c<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">'curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain leanprover/lean4:stable || (echo &amp;&amp; read -n 1 -s -r -p \"Install failed, press ENTER to continue...\")'</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">exit</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The bash and powershell scripts to install elan are not linked anywhere on the webpage. I'm personally more comfortable with installing using the terminal, so my first instinct after I didn't find any shell commands on the webpage was to run <code>sudo apt install elan</code>, but this unfortunately gave me version <code>1.something</code> of elan which was hopelessly out of date.</p>\n<p>I think it's totally reasonable to have the default installation method be through the setup guide on VSCode, since many mathematicians aren't familiar with the terminal. However, if it won't cause any maintenance issues, could there at least be a link to shell based installation instructions (such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/elan#manual-installation\">official elan installation instructions</a>), for advanced users? Right now the only link on the official installation instructions webpage is to here: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/releases\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/releases</a>, which I think is probably the last link we want to be providing new users.</p>",
