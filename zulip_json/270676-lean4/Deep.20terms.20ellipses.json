The issue is that it seems to use a definition of depth that is not the relevant one, at least for mathematics. In <code>a + b + c + d</code>, all letters are at the same depth for mathematicians. More generally, a function taking several (explicit) arguments has all its arguments at the same depth in general. This is very different from <code>a (b (c d))</code>. If we can’t agree on this, could the elision be opt-in? At the very least, can the popup you get when clicking on <code>…</code> mention how to configure the depth that is showed? And is there an option you can put in the lakefile to set the default depth for the project?</p>",

The way it would work is that when you initially hover, you get the brief docstring, and if you either click on an \"expand\"-type button (or maybe wait long enough), you get the full docstring?</p>\n<p>An encoding hack would be to use html comments to indicate a point in the docstring, where everything before it is the brief docstring, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"sd\">/--</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">The `⋯` term denotes a term that was omitted by the pretty printer.&lt;!--brief--&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">The presence of `⋯` in pretty printer output is controlled by the `pp.deepTerms` and `pp.proofs` options,</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">and these options can be further adjusted using `pp.deepTerms.threshold` and `pp.proofs.threshold`.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">It is only meant to be used for pretty printing.</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">However, in case it is copied and pasted from the Infoview, `⋯` logs a warning and elaborates like `_`.</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">-/</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@[</span><span class=\"n\">builtin_term_parser</span><span class=\"kd\">]</span> <span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">omission</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">leading_parser</span>\n  <span class=\"s2\">\"⋯\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The reason why hovering over <code>⋯</code> doesn't show the docstring at all is that it's mostly noise that just increases the size of the hover box.
