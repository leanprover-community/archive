Before I left I started porting a mathlib4 file. On the way to Nottingham I realised that my Lean 4 installation was borked and so the proposed demo I was going to give was rapidly rewritten for Lean 3. On the way home I was going to work on porting the file but I can't use mathlib at all right now. Does anyone have any advice? I have very patchy internet so it's going to be hard to switch to master and download oleans.</p>",
