I'm sure this is super obvious and written up somewhere (which, by the way, if you have a link would be super helpful) but how do i transform a part of my goal from<br>\n<code>{ a := x } != { a:= y }</code> to <code>x != y</code>? Specifically I want some form of a rewrite and not an entire application. I tried <code>rw [congr]</code> and <code>congr</code> but the former rightfully yells at me for trying to rewrite using a mv and the latter just doesn't make progress. i also tried <code>congr' 1</code>but that says <code>congr'</code> isn't recognized, and i think i saw it in the mathlib3 docs but not <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Init/Prelude.html#congr\">mathlib 4</a> so that makes sense, i just don't know what the right tactic is and none of the congruence ones listed on the page i linked seem like they'd work. <br>\nThank you!</p>",
