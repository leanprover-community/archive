In my goal type, I have a term <code>@foo a [_: Instance b]</code> where <code>Instance a</code> <em>cannot</em> be inferred by typeclass synthesis, but <code>Instance b</code> works because <code>b</code> was rewritten to <code>a</code> earlier and they are defeq in a way that synthesis doesn't see through. Then I want to rewrite by <code>fooThm (x) : @foo x [_: Instance x] = bar</code>.  Unfortunately, <code>rw [fooThm]</code> unifies <code>x := a</code>and then tries to synthesize the instance, which fails. Can I make it \"pick up\" the instance from the term instead, i.e. unify against it?</p>",
