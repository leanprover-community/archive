I now found out that the <code>constructor</code> tactic can be used to construct such structures as well. (Similarly, you can use <code>cases/rcases</code> to access fields.) This behavior is present even with the new module system enabled. Is this intended? It doesn't seem right to me that <code>private</code> acts effectively as a lint when applied to structure constructors or fields.</p>",
