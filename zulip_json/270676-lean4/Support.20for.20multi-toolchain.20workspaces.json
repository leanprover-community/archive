It resolves several long-standing usability issues with the VS Code extension that disproportionally affect new users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is now possible to open Lean 4 files in VS Code without first having to open the respective project as a folder.</li>\n<li>When opening a parent or a sub folder of a Lean 4 project and then opening files within it, Lean will work as expected.</li>\n<li>When opening a folder that contains multiple Lean 4 projects and then opening files within it, Lean will work as expected and use the correct language server for each given file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This PR is a significant refactor of the VS Code extension. It is likely that it still contains some bugs. I would greatly appreciate if people from the Lean community could help me test this version before it is released to everyone by installing the current vscode-lean4 pre-release (version 0.0.142) that contains this PR:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/hiAMkTs8YFi6Axxcr9xOrSbS/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/hiAMkTs8YFi6Axxcr9xOrSbS/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/hiAMkTs8YFi6Axxcr9xOrSbS/image.png\"></a></div><p>Please let me know about any new issues you encounter while using the pre-release version.</p>\n<p>One caveat is that due to a limitation in the language client library used by the extension, vscode-lean4 unfortunately does not correctly support nested Lean projects yet. Similarly, when opening Lean files that are not contained in any Lean 4 project, the VS Code extension will use the parent folder of that file for the project scope of the language client. This means that if a non-project Lean file above a Lean 4 project is opened, it effectively acts like a nested project and will not work correctly, either. I hope to resolve these problems at some point in the future as well.</p>",

In nested projects, vscode-lean4 picks the outer-most <code>lean-toolchain</code> it can find (unless you opened a folder that contains a <code>lean-toolchain</code> file, in which case it stops searching at the folder boundary so that it will not see any <code>lean-toolchain</code> files above it). This is the correct behavior for Lean files in <code>.lake</code> and it results in less catastrophic failures in combination with the language-client library than the alternative of using the inner-most <code>lean-toolchain</code> file to define the scope.</p>\n<p>Eventually, when we patch the language-client library to support nested clients, we should be able to use the inner-most <code>lean-toolchain</code> file instead and this interaction will work fine as well.</p>",
