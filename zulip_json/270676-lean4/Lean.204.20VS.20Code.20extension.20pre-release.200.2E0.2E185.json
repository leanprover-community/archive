It enables the InfoView to be detached into a separate window on sufficiently recent VS Code versions (e.g. for use on a second monitor), improves the UX of the startup errors that users see when their setup is broken and adds a small spinner to the InfoView to indicate when it is busy loading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QLl67kDPV8plpX9vr-FmxuGO/detach-infoview.gif\">Demo of detachable InfoView</a></p>\n<p>Since these changes also include a larger refactoring, I would be very grateful for some pre-release testing of these changes before they are released to everyone. You can opt-in to pre-release versions of the Lean 4 VS Code extension by right-clicking the 'Lean 4' extension in the 'Extensions' sidebar menu and clicking 'Switch to Pre-Release Version'.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/iQK6w7hRWWLWlrdfu4inDFAl/prerelease.png\">Switching to pre-release versions</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/iQK6w7hRWWLWlrdfu4inDFAl/prerelease.png\" title=\"Switching to pre-release versions\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"1012x546\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/iQK6w7hRWWLWlrdfu4inDFAl/prerelease.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>The full release notes can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/releases/tag/v0.0.185-pre\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Please report all regressions you encounter on the pre-release version in this thread so that I can fix them before the final release.
