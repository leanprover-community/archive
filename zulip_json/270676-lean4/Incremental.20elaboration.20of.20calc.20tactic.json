A lot of my proofs consist of relatively large (~500 lines) calc blocks, which take a very long time to update when I make small incremental changes. Even with liberal use of <code>stop</code> and commenting out steps, I still often need to wait up to 10 seconds every change. I've heard that a few versions ago some tactic elaboration became incremental; is there any chance <code>calc</code> could make use of this feature somehow?</p>",
