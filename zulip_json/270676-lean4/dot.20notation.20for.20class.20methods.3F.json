(or even funkier: type classes that only have 1 parameter that is not an out param?) in which case (given that we know the type of  the thing that is getting \"dotted\" of course) we should be able to come up with a correct TC synthesis query? Another interesting question might be how to deal with type classes like functor? So for example when I have <code>x : Array a</code> and I do <code>x.map ...</code> the query would have to..I guess speculatively try to find instances for just <code>Array</code>? That does seem kinda hacky as well though so maybe it would be better to limit to just: Type classes that only have a single not  out param.</p>",
