I see the reasoning for this (which of course makes sense) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These environment variables are already configured during sever setup by <code>lake serve</code> and do not change on a per-file basis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I don't really see another convenient to actually retrieve this information now -- specifically it looks like <code>lake env</code>'s <code>LEAN_SRC_PATH</code> is the data I want, but unless I'm missing something it's only available there through that command (in shell format).</p>\n<p>Am I missing another easier place which has this info? <code>lean.nvim</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/Julian/lean.nvim/blob/1ec98cc9975ef67c43057de49b8d8c818402c547/lua/lean/init.lua#L200-L231\">uses it</a> to implement things like \"I want to open any one of the .lean files that Lean has on its import path\".</p>",
