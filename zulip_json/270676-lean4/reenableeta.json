(Also the underlying lean4 changes at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/compare/master...gebner:lean4:reenableeta\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/compare/master...gebner:lean4:reenableeta</a>.)</p>\n<p>This came up when we were looking at the slow <code>isDefEq</code> problem discussed at <a href=\"#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/LinearAlgebra.2EDeterminant.20!4.233694\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/LinearAlgebra.2EDeterminant.20!4.233694</a>.</p>\n<p>Would you be able to give us a quick update on the status of this branch, and the prospects for it going somewhere? Obviously it would be lovely if it worked, but maybe there are reasons to curb our enthusiasm?</p>",
