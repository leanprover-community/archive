And in that video from YouTube Channel \"LeanProver\" most likey, they demonstrated the installation process via VS Code extension and Mathslib library via python.</p>\n<p>I actually resorted to a video for installation as it was really confusing how to install Lean, at the first place. Because there were so many websites, notes and materials that it's hard to understand, which one is the updated source/official source. </p>\n<p>I believe, Lean, should take a python approach and list all its previous versions and their documentations in one place, to avoid confusion. Otherwise it is difficult in the sense, many individuals/old projects still use previous versions of Lean and each time there's a version update Lean, ends-up creating a new website, which adds more to the confusion.</p>",
