In one of the installation steps, it is mentioned to use the command \"elan toolchain install leanprover/lean4:stable\", which starts downloading the file \"lean-4.20.0-windows.tar.zst\". However, due to my very poor internet connection, this download fails every time. I have directly downloaded the \"lean-4.20.0-windows.tar.zst\" file myself. Now, how can I use toolchain to install it from the file on my computer's hard drive (the downloaded file) instead of downloading it from the internet?</p>",
