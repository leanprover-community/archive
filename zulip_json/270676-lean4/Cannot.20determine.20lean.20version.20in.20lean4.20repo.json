It's fixed by <a href=\"https://github.com/ccache/ccache/commit/6372b867387648ce79b58c54ce345c2442c9493d\">this patch</a> and the patch was released in 4.8.2. I got it working on my local branch with a <code>nix flake update</code>, which bumps CCache to 4.8.3. If there are no other problems, I think the flake lock should be bumped? I can submit a PR if needed.</p>",
