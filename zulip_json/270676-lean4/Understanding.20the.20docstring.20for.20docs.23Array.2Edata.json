For <code>Array.mk</code>, this certainly true as <code>List.toArray</code> is defined a little ways down in the same file. Unfortunately, <code>Array.toList</code> is defined separately in <code>Init.Data.Array.Basic</code>, so it is harder to keep <code>Array.data</code> honest (even though I suspect it still is).  Regardless, <code>implemented_by</code> simply does not work across files (understandably), so that separation does prevent it from being use for <code>Array.data</code>.
