Since this is the first time I'm working on Lean, I forked the repository and cloned it. I then built lean with the instructions in the doc file at the lean4 repository <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/2952cf81e6089626f96321b44307d2222bc74d03/doc/make/msys2.md\">here</a>. I then followed the instructions in a different file <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/2952cf81e6089626f96321b44307d2222bc74d03/doc/dev/index.md\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I've managed to get the directory in a configuration where <code>lean --version</code> throws an error, but I just finished multiple hours of building and would prefer to fix it rather than rip everything out and try again. Any help debugging this would be appreciated.</p>",
