However, if you do instantiate the metavariable, then all goals disappear as expected.</p>\n<p>I was mainly wondering if this was expected, because we sometimes have a few metavariables that aren't resolved until the very end with a large context and perform rewrites, which seems to slow down the vscode window and maybe lean itself because it tries to display all the repeated contexts.</p>",
