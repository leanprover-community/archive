Here, the hypothesis <code>(hA : A.IsHermitian)</code> is a hypothesis I need for the theorem to be true, and I use it in <code>rw</code> command. Since I refer to it, it would then get added as an (explicit) argument to my <code>smul</code> theorem. After bumping the version, this no longer seems to work, and it now (1) complains that hA is an unknown identifier, and (2) smul doesn't take that argument any more.</p>\n<p>I couldn't find anything referring to this change in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/RELEASES.md\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/RELEASES.md</a>, but I may well be blind or failing to interpret some change correctly. Is there a good way to recover this behavior? Or has it been decided (by fiat) that Prop-typed variables to theorems should never be added by a <code>variable</code> command?</p>",
