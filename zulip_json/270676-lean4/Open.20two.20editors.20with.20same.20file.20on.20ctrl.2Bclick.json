Is there a way to open <em>two</em> (or more) editors with the same file, in case I want to ctrl+click on more than one declaration but both are defined in the same file? What happens now is that if both <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are defined in <code>file.lean</code>, when I ctrl+click on <code>foo</code> the editors goes to the line of <code>foo</code>,  and if I ctrl+click on <code>bar</code> the same editor moves to the line where <code>bar</code> is defined, but now I do not see <code>foo</code> any more. I would like to end up with two editors, one with <code>file.lean</code> at the <code>foo</code> line  and the other with <code>file.lean</code> at the <code>bar</code> line.</p>",
