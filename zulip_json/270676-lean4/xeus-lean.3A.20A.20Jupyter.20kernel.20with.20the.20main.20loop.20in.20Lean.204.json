The key characteristic of this implementation is that <strong>the main loop and kernel logic are implemented in Lean 4 itself</strong> (binding to <code>xeus</code> via FFI), rather than wrapping Lean from C++.</p>\n<p>This serves as a proof-of-concept for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using Lean 4 for system-level programming and complex C++ interoperability.</li>\n<li>Creating interactive environments purely within the Lean ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Future Roadmap:</strong> My ultimate goal involves <strong>compiling this kernel to WebAssembly (WASM)</strong>. This would enable Lean 4 to run entirely in the browser via <strong>JupyterLite</strong>, providing a zero-setup, interactive learning environment for tutorials and textbooks without backend servers.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps anyone looking to run Lean 4 in Jupyter notebooks. Feedback and contributions are welcome!</p>",
