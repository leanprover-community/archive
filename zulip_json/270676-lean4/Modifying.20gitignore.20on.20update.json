However, when switching to <code>4.3.0-rc2</code> from an older version, it seems that all the build artifacts end up in a new folder called <code>.lake</code>, while <code>.lake</code> is not added to the <code>.gitignore</code> file automatically. This could bite new users. </p>\n<p>Should the this update process also add a new line to <code>.gitignore</code> with <code>.lake</code>? What do people think about this?</p>",
