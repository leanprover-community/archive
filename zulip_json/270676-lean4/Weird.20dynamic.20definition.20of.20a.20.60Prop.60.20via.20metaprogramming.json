Mutual would be okay. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243562\">@Adam Topaz</span> It would be totally fine to have the <code>P</code> in <code>thing</code> elaborated as well. Do you think you could give me a pointer on how to do that? I don't understand how it's possible to refer to the goal in <code>thing</code> from <code>P</code>. Is there some sort of thing analogous to <code>withMainContext</code> that allows me to peer into the types of stuff that's been mutually defined? An example would be a godsend!</p>",
