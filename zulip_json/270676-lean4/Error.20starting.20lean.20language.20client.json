My basic environment is Windows 10 and Visual Studio Code  1.85 (see below for details). I have checked out the MathLib tutorial and clicked into S01_Getting_Started.lean. In the Lean Infoview, I can see the message Waiting for Lean server to start... </p>\n<p>VS Code also displays Starting Lean language client, but this message never goes away. I selected the Manage Extension window, and under RUNTIME STATUS, I see this message (displayed twice): Header must provide a Content-Length property.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know what the problem is, and how I can get past this problem?
