Perhaps I'll have more luck here?</p>\n<p>I would like to have multiple InfoViews for the following reason:  When I am working on a proof in file A, I may want to create a lemma in file B (which file A imports) that would be useful in the proof in A.  It would be very convenient if I can look at the proof state in A while formulating the lemma in B.  But this is impossible when there is only one InfoView window.</p>",
