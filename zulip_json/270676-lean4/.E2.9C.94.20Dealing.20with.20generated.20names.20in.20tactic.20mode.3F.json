Is there a way to just name an anonymous hypothesis? (by order, presumably). Or a way to disable the anonymous generation (so all names are accessible?). I sort of get the desire to have names be written in code (using generated names _can_ be fragile), but having some way of accessing them seems important (given the tactics _do_ generate them...)</p>",
