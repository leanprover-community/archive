But would be nice to keep it in sync, I wonder if Kevin's code could be layered in a way that serves both purposes.  I also found the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-samples/tree/main/ListComprehension\">ListComprehension</a>  sample (originally posted in Zulip) very educational which is why I posted it in the samples repo.  There was supposed to be a triggered CI build of the samples that reported any build breaks immediately.</p>",
