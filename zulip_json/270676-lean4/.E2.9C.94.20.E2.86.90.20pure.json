I expect we'll end up reworking the internals of resolved topics to change that detail, and the end result of those efforts will be that this particularly common case of link issues will be removed that way.</p>\n<p>(There's a broader issue with moving content between topics, and we have some plans for that, but they're a bit less near-term).</p>",
