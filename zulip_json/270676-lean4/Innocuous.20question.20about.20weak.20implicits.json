Perhaps I was just blindly applying internal rules about weak implicits, perhaps this is the result of some blind search/replace, or perhaps I really meant this alternation of strong and weak implicits. Regardless, I'm now rather puzzled what this mix of strong and weak implicit parameter means.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking there is no real context where this is different from  <code>{{t : α}} {x₁ x₂ : β} {y : γ}</code>. I'm not sure. I would really like to know how weak and strong implicit parameters work when interlaced.</p>\n<p>PS: Sorry if that's in the docs somewhere. I didn't find it, but I might have been using the wrong keywords.</p>",
