The lemma for which this bug occurred is not the one in the current file--the bug happened for two lemmas which were edited out in the review process. The lemmas held for topological groups in general, so it was suggested they should not be in the <code>NonarchimedeanGroup</code> namespace, but should instead either be moved to the <code>TopologicalGroup</code> file or changed to <code>private lemma</code>s.</p>",
