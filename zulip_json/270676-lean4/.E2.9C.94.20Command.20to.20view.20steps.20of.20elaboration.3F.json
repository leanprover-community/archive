What I want is a command that takes some valid piece of lean syntax and shows the process of how its elaborated. For example, if you did something like <code>#&lt;hypothetical command&gt; for x in xs do sorry</code> it might print the syntax it came from, the macros and elaborators it used, all the way up to the result you would get with something like <code>#print</code>. Does something like exist? If not, is there a good way I can manually do this? I'm trying to better understand how this process works for common lean features. Thanks!</p>",
