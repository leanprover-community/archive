I'm trying to install lean4 using the instructions in <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html\">https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html</a>, but it fails.  First the \"install Lean using Elan\"  dialogue failed to pop up. I then tried to install lean by copying a binary from the dristibution and pointing som e  variables at it, but got <a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/0KpCylsHFXvp5RIV4w-oVZ4z/image.png\">image.png</a>  ... so I don't understand what's going on.   Does anyone have any hints?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/0KpCylsHFXvp5RIV4w-oVZ4z/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/0KpCylsHFXvp5RIV4w-oVZ4z/image.png\"></a></div>",
