However, I don't want to rewrite the proofs and I want the docstring I already written to show on the website. I saw in the Verso examples that something very similiar have been done for the demo website using <code>def_literate_page</code> or <code>def_literate_post</code>. I'm wondering if there is a way to do the same with the manual genre. The final result I would like would be a front page like the example of the Zippers package with an introductory text and links to pages that represent an external Lean file.<br>\nI apologize if this is not clear or if my vocabulary is not correct.</p>",
