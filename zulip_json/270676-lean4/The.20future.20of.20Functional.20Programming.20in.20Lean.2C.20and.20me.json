I'm looking forward to getting back into programming and documentation work full time - I expect to be on here a lot more as well.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, though, I'll be completely swamped preparing my current job for a smooth transition to my successor.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Lean FRO for the opportunity!</p>",
