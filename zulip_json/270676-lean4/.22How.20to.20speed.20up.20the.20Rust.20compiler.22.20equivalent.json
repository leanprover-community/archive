Bigger efforts at Lean compiler speedup typically appear on Zulip, but I don't think there is a quite an equivalent at the level of detail provided by Nicholas's posts. E.g., one paragraph from this month's:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/147293\">#147293</a>: In the query system there was a value computed on a hot path that was only used within a <code>debug!</code> call. In this PR I avoided doing that computation unless necessary, which gave icount reductions across many benchmark results, more than 3% in the best case. This was such a classic micro-optimization that I added it as an example to the <a href=\"https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/logging-and-debugging.html\">Logging and Debugging</a> chapter of the <a href=\"https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/\">The Rust Performance Book</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there something I could follow that is similar?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nnethercote.github.io/2025/12/05/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-december-2025.html\">https://nnethercote.github.io/2025/12/05/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-december-2025.html</a></p>",
