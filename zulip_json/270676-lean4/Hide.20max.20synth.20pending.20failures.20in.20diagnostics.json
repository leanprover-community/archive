This means I don't care about the diagnostics messages themselves, so I want to hide them. Setting <code>diagnostics.threshold</code> to a really large number hides most of them, but the <code>[type_class] max synth pending failures (maxSynthPendingDepth: 1), use 'set_option maxSynthPendingDepth &lt;limit&gt;'</code> remain.<br>\nIs there a way to get rid of these messages? <code>maxSynthPendingDepth</code> affects not just the message from what I understand, so isn't what I want</p>",
