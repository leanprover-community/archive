In Lean, this might look something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">have</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">h_bounded</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∀</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">n'</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∃</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Fin</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n'</span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n<span class=\"n\">use</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">fun</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">↦</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h_bounded</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">choose</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">⟨</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">by</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">...</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">⟩</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>While Lean accepts this, I believe this approach is incorrect as it involves the axiom of choice? My only knowledge of what the axiom is comes from the same chapter:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/BXKNNKz--IL1b9yQVtrPMWZ-/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/BXKNNKz--IL1b9yQVtrPMWZ-/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"595x123\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/BXKNNKz--IL1b9yQVtrPMWZ-/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>It sounds like we're making an infinite number of choices and using this same technique, I can prove the unbounded version of the lemma that the remark is saying cannot be proven yet.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I'm guessing this is not the intended solution. But I also cannot for the life of me figure out what is. Any gentle nudge towards the right direction would be greatly appreciated :D</p>",

        "content": "<p>The reason that in the set theory, this does not need choice, is that all the existence is unique. So you are not \"really\" making any choices, since there is only one thing to choose each time. Functions are implemented as a special type of relation, and unique choice is an easy lemma. However the way Lean's type theory works is somewhat different. A function according to Lean is a something that takes inputs of the correct type and constructs an output of the correct type. Since we actually need to construct the value, proving existence (even unique existence) is not enough on its own, you also need the axiom of choice to \"construct\" the output given a proof of existence.</p>",
