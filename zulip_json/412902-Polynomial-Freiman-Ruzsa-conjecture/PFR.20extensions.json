I have just pushed a preliminary version of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1\">#1</a> and will keep working on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1\">#1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/2\">#2</a> over the weekend.</p>\n<p>In about a week, my coauthors and I will also be ready to release our preprint for PFR in the odd torsion case, and I will also work on extending the blueprint to cover this case also (though this is a more substantial extension).  Finally, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"458865\">@Thomas Bloom</span> has volunteered to write a blueprint on an application of PFR to a weak Freiman-Ruzsa theorem over the integers.  </p>\n<p>I am then hoping to get these extensions worked out slowly over the next few weeks, possibly also testing experimental Blueprint features along the way.

I just created a stub file ApproximateHomomorphism.lean (using the brand new <code>proof_wanted</code> feature) to contain all the Section 9 material.

I've now also taken the liberty of making a tentative formalization of BSG (using our new additive energy notation) in order to unblock the various tasks around \"approximate homomorphism form of PFR\".  In particular I put in some placeholder values for the constants that will show up in these theorems, though they may be subject to change later once BSG actually gets formalized.</p>",
