Everything should compile fine as far as I can see, but sorry if there are any lingering bugs.</p>\n<p>This deduction is exactly as proved by Green, Manners, and Tao in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13403.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13403.pdf</a> - I only made a couple of obvious simplifications given the actual form of PFR proven. Any mistakes are, of course, entirely due to me.  If anyone is confused by a proof, feels that something is wrong or missing, then please check the original paper and/or post in this thread.</p>",
