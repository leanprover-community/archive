(I understand that I could presumably save the hour or two of building by doing <code>lake cache get</code> or something, but I'm not touching Lean any time soon, so I'm happy to just let it run. Still, I'm glad we waited until the project got over the finish line before approving the Mathlib rollover.)</p>",
