(I understand that I could presumably save the hour or two of building by doing <code>lake cache get</code> or something, but I'm not touching Lean any time soon, so I'm happy to just let it run. Still, I'm glad we waited until the project got over the finish line before approving the Mathlib rollover.)</p>",

Then one doesn't have to explicitly carry the uniform random variables and their supporting structures throughout the argument (and particularly throughout the inductive part of weakPFR).  It could also simplify PFR itself a little bit (though it's much less of an issue there because one is not performing induction), and also removes a minor universe issue (I had to suddenly care about which universe everything belonged to in order to perform induction).  I could try developing this approach if you think it is worthwhile, though of course I don't want to interfere with your bump.</p>",

Very often we care only about the law of the variables, and because we talk about random variables we need Ω and a <code>Measurable X</code> assumption which we have to carry along. All the entropy and Ruzsa distance definitions are more naturally written about measures; at several steps of the blueprint there are remarks stating that random variables need not be defined on the same space and as far as I can tell it's because only their laws matter... In some places we even explicitly change the domain of the random variables even though that domain should not matter.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about trying to refactor the code to use less random variables and see how simpler it can get, but that's a lot of refactoring and I am only midly curious.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, I think that a definition of a Ruzsa distance between sets equal to the distance between uniform measures is a good idea: if the choice of measure don't matter, let's not introduce the measure and work as much as possible with the sets only.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Good point.  In particular we should define the uniform probability measure <code>Measure.uniform A</code> of a finite non-empty subset <code>A</code> of an ambient (<code>MeasurableSingletonClass</code>) space <code>G</code>, and use the measure-theoretic version of Ruzsa distance to define <code>dᵤ[A # B]</code>.  I had in mind a much more complicated definition involving <code>exists_isUniform_measureSpace</code> (and the axiom of choice) that would have been considerably worse to work with. (EDIT: once one had <code>Measure.uniform</code>, one could refactor the <code>IsUniform</code> API accordingly.)</p>\n<p>The one nice thing about working with random variables instead of measures is that algebraic facts about (deterministic) variables in the range space carry over quite painlessly to the random variables.  For instance, if <code>G</code> is an elementary abelian 2-group, we have <code>x+y=x-y</code> for all <code>x y: G</code>, and hence we pretty much automatically have <code>X+Y=X-Y</code> for all <code>X Y: Ω → G</code> as well.  Admittedly it's not <em>that</em> much harder to show that <code>μXY.map (fun x ↦ x.1 + x.2) = μXY.map (fun x ↦ x.1 - x.2)</code> (where <code>μXY</code> is the joint distribution of <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, which for instance might be <code>μX.prod μY</code> if <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> are independent) but it's visually and conceptually harder to follow arguments structured in that fashion.</p>\n<p>I think I will create a separate file to try to set up uniform measures and Ruzsa distance between sets, but not touch the main project files such as weakPFR.lean for now, just to see how it would work.</p>",

If one worked only with distributions, then every time one wanted to introduce a new random variable, one would have to replace the previous joint distribution with a product of that measure with the new distribution, and make sure that all previously established facts about the prior distribution lift to the new one.  For instance, if one already had some inequalities concerning independent random variables <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, and some inequalities concerning independent random variables <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code>, and now wanted to combine these inequalities to form a more complex inequality relating jointly independent variables <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code>, then a number of lifting arguments would have to be made before the inequalities could be combined if one was working in a purely distribution-based formalism.  In our current framework we rely in the various <code>independent_copies</code> lemmas to do all this lifting at the very beginning of the argument instead of in the middle.  Potentially a refactor would still be cleaner though.</p>",
