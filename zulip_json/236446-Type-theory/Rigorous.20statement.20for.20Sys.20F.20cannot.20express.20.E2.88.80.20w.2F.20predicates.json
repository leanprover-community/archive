From what I've managed to gather, System F <em>can</em> express quantification, but only over types, and not over elements or predicates. </p>\n<p>I'm looking for a way to formalize this statement in order to start working on a proof. How could I express: System F lacks the expressive power to state quantification over terms? Or, lacks the expressive power to state quantification in the way made possible by dependent types?</p>",
