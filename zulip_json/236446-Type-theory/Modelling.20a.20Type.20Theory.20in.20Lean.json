If you define the predicate by recursion over terms instead, you can't directly eliminate a hypothesis <code>WF t</code>; you'll have to eliminate <code>t</code> first until the <code>WF</code> reduces. (In your case, there's little difference in this regard because the structure of your well-formedness predicate is very close to the structure of your terms.)</li>\n<li>Recursive definitions must pass the termination checker; inductive definitions are generally more liberal. (Also not a concern in your case because you don't need a complicated recursive structure.)</li>\n<li>Lean may make the recursive definition extra cumbersome to use because it's picky about reducing definitional equalities (though that might not be a problem in practice; I haven't experimented with this). Maybe mark the <code>WF</code> def as <code>@[reducible]</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Benefits of a recursive definition of well-formedness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It may be a little clearer what's going on I guess?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"255481\">Billy Price</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/236446-Type-theory/topic/Modelling.20a.20Type.20Theory.20in.20Lean/near/195715381\" title=\"#narrow/stream/236446-Type-theory/topic/Modelling.20a.20Type.20Theory.20in.20Lean/near/195715381\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Surely if I use inductive, I can only talking about creating un-named elements of <code>Prop</code>, and I can't actually define which proposition they are right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry, I don't understand your concern; could you rephrase?</p>",

construct a big term inductively from smaller terms, you need to know the whole context of the big term to construct and use the variables of the small terms. Obviously this is unsustainable, so I think I need to create a function for modifying contexts. I don't think there's many restrictions on the kind of context modification you can do, which includes adding more context to the end of the context, lifting the context and inserting other context before it, and also any reordering of types in the existing context. Perhaps there's some general pattern there, but I'm struggling to even define a simple case. If I mention <code>A</code> more than once between then <code>|</code> and the <code>:=</code>, it tells me <code>A already appears in this pattern</code>. I understand why that's an error, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do instead. I haven't been able to write the other cases for similar reasons.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">add_junk</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">β</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kn\">context</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">Π</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"err\">Γ</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kn\">context</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">type</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">term</span> <span class=\"err\">Γ</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">term</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">list</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span> <span class=\"err\">Γ</span> <span class=\"n\">β</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">list</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span> <span class=\"err\">Γ</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"bp\">::</span><span class=\"err\">Δ</span><span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">var</span> <span class=\"err\">Γ</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"err\">Δ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span> <span class=\"err\">Γ</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">list</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span> <span class=\"err\">Δ</span> <span class=\"n\">β</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
