The core result: for a type system with fixed axes (like structure, inheritance, hierarchy), there exists a domain whose requirements cannot be fully captured. This isn't a limitation of specific languages, it's a mathematical impossibility result.</p>\n<p>What's in the zip</p>\n<p>Full Lean 4 formalization (compiles with lake build) Instantiations for Python, TypeScript, Java, and Rust The axioms for type system structure are extracted from actual language specifications, not invented</p>\n<p>Main theorem: For any fixed-axis type framework, there exists a domain D such that no complete typing is achievable.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if this doesn't hold and why. If there is an error this is a great opportunity to learn!<br>\n<a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/18173678\">https://zenodo.org/records/18173678</a></p>",
