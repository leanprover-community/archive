I do some work with quaternionic automorphic forms in my regular work so I figured I'd take a stab at <a href=\"https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/FLT/blueprint/Quat_alg_project.html#TotallyDefiniteQuaternionAlgebra.WeightTwoAutomorphicForm.finiteDimensional**\">11.6</a>, using Fujisaki as a black box for now (though it seems like it's <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/pull/641\">close</a> to being done). Is anyone already working on 11.6? I don't see it on the dashboard, at least.</p>",
