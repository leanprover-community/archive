On 1st October the funding starts and I'll release some material and there will be things for people to work on, including formalising some quite basic stuff, and there will be parts of the blueprint graph which will be \\emph{active} and fast-changing, unlike the majority of the blueprint graph which will remain static for the near future. The hive of activity will be some random small connected component in the graph, and furthermore it will jump about randomly on the whim of the graph visualisation software. </p>\n<p>I noticed that in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/liquid/index.html\">LTE</a> they have two blueprint graphs. Does anyone know how this was done? I would rather have small components being viewable separately than everything being in one big chaotic mess.</p>",
