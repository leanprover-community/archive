So now FLT has a bunch of linters running and if your PR doesn't pass them, it will fail CI. </p>\n<p>However there are already a bunch of things merged into the project that would have failed CI but didn't, because they were merged before yesterday. These things are now tracked in the file <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/blob/main/scripts/nolints.json\">scripts/nolints.json</a>. This file was 250 lines long yesterday and almost all complaints in it are of the form \"this definition doesn't have a docstring\". If you see some definitions in there and you think you know what they are, then feel free to write a PR adding docstrings and then run the magic incantation <code>lake exe runLinter --update FLT</code> and you'll find that the file magically gets smaller. For example I made a PR adding a bunch of docstrings yesterday in the adele files, so I could get on top of where we were, and then I made this <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/pull/442\">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/pull/442</a> and the nolints file went from 250 lines to 200 :-)</p>\n<p>My priority at the minute is to get docstrings on the declaractions which are \"active\" parts of the project (e.g. adeles right now, Hecke operators later this week when I get back to them)</p>",
