The lecture is possibly at <time datetime=\"2024-12-09T13:00:00Z\">2024-12-09T13:00:00Z</time> -- that should be 1pm London time and 8am Pittsburgh time tomorrow Monday, let me know if I screwed up, because parts of my computer think it's GMT and other parts think it's Eastern US time right now (I'm in Pittsburgh -- the lecture is coming live from the Hoskinson center).</p>\n<p>In the first hour I will go through a maths proof that a space of quaternionic modular forms is finite-dimensional, and then people can just go ahead and formalize issues in the second hour. I'm also sick of using an iPad to deliver lectures so I'm going to try pdf slides, which I'll post here after the lecture (I've not written them yet). I'll be assuming that you know what the adeles of a number field <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span></span></span></span> are but most of the time I'll only be using the fact that they're a locally compact topological <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">K</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">K</span></span></span></span>-algebra.</p>",

I see, how about this for a workflow: first I add a bunch of issues but don't assign them to the project, and then I write the sorries and add the issue numbers, and then I put the issues on the dashboard, and then I write the blueprint last.</p>",
