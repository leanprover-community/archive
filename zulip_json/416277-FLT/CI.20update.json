We now have activated a bunch of linters in CI which will check for things like: <code>FLT.lean</code> not being a list of the files in the project, lines being more than 100 characters long, definitions not having docstrings and so on. I did a bunch of work on the project today which caused several PRs to pick up merge conflicts; I fixed the conflicts because I could see how I'd caused them, but in the process of merging master I of course triggered the new CI, so I'm really sorry <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"650358\">@Salvatore Mercuri</span> (<a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/pull/414\">FLT#414</a>) and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"869628\">@Matthew Jasper</span> (<a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/pull/432\">FLT#432</a>), I broke your PRs! Hopefully it's nothing worse than having to add a few docstrings, but another change was that I streamlined imports so there is a chance that you might have had to add some back to get things working again. Looks like all the Lean code is compiling now at least...</p>",
