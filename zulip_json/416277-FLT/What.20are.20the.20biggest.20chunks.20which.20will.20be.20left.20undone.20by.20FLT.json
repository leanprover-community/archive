The first things which came to mind were Jacquet-Langlands and Langlands-Tunnel since both were already known, I think both are necessary, and I can't imagine anybody casually doing those and adding them to mathlib in the background.</p>",

Mazur, Jacquet-Langlands, cyclic base change + classification of image, and attaching Galois representations to Hilbert modular forms (which will need cohomology of Shimura surfaces) are all things which will be assumed in the EPSRC-funded part of the program. You're wrong about Langlands--Tunnell, that has not been necessary for years, read chapters 2 and 3 of the blueprint to see the route we're taking.</p>",
