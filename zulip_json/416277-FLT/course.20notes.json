The lectures are not being publically live streamed but if you're attached to the university of Bristol, Bath, Swansea, Warwick or Oxford then you can register to watch them via the EPSRC TCC, and if you're at Imperial then you can do this and you can also attend in person.</p>\n<p>I've just uploaded the first lecture to the FLT repo here <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/tree/main/2026_EPSRC_TCC_course\">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/tree/main/2026_EPSRC_TCC_course</a> .</p>",
