This has involved writing some code which refers to <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=FermatLastTheorem#doc\">docs#FermatLastTheorem</a> a lot. Note \"Fermat\", not \"Fermat's\". I've written \"FermatLastTheorem\" quite a bit now and it still sounds really odd to me. This change was added to my FLT mathlib PR by Yael <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6508#discussion_r1314730999\">here</a> at the same time as another change, and I didn't notice this until the PR was merged. </p>\n<p>I propose changing <code>FermatLast</code> to <code>FermatsLast</code> throughout that mathlib file. Are there reasons why I shouldn't do this, e.g. to do with the naming convention? My argument for the change is simply \"Fermat's Last Theorem is what everyone calls it in English\".</p>",
