I tried passing the goal in order to see (at the current moment I'm only focusing on fixing the single-goal case, not <code>solve_by_elim*</code>) and instead do <code>goal.withContext (do println! l)</code>, but that also doesn't work and gives the same thing. I then tried <code>goal.withContext (do let x := l.mapM ppExpr; println! (← x))</code> as a last-ditch guess and variations and it doesn't seem right.
