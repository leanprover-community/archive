I'm interested in formalising Lie theory as well and would not like to duplicate work if I can avoid it, and I'm sure that I'm not alone in that.</p>",

I do have a branch where I do experimentation, but it is just a mess of failed tries. Mathlib4's treatment of root systems is at a level of generality that is not treated in the literature, so I tend to add PRs after I've worked out new steps informally.

I doubt then that reading a book like <a href=\"https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~aknapp/download/Beyond2.pdf\">Lie Groups: Beyond an Introduction (link to publically available pdf)</a>  would be enough preperation to try to help out then.
