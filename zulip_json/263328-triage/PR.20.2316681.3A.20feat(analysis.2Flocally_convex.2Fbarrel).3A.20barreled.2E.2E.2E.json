The reason is that I took a different (and more general) approach to barrelled spaces and Banach-Steinhaus in Lean4, by relying entirely on seminorms instead of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=LocallyConvexSpace#doc\">docs#LocallyConvexSpace</a>, thus allowing any <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=NontriviallyNormedField#doc\">docs#NontriviallyNormedField</a>. But there are still some geometric characterizations in the case of real vector spaces, and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16681\">!3#16681</a> contains some steps towards these.</p>",
