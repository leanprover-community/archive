You're not expected to add inhabited instances for <code>α ≃ β</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>Some people like the linter because it reminds you to add an example value of your new type.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It used to be the inhabited instance linter back then, but in the meantime we changed it to be the nonempty instance linter because people were filling it with noncomputable instances.</p>",
