You can rewrite with congruence mod n, as the PR shows, but you can also rewrite with another divisibility relation. In the current implementation, these two options cannot co-exist.</p>\n<p>What I would like, is that <code>grw</code> can check if the used relation is symmetric, and if so, prove an iff instead of just an implication. That way, these two grw options will both be available.</p>\n<p>So tldr, it depends on some other PR that I haven't made yet.</p>",
