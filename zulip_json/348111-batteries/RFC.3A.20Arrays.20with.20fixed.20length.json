        "content": "<p>The fact that we don't have a type <code>{arr : Array A // arr.size = n}</code> is a consistent source of pain when doing monadic verification of code containing arrays. The <code>set</code> function can potentially change <code>arr.size</code>, so any time you are using <code>set</code> you need to carry around something saying actually the size is still what it was before so that you can still index into it with <code>Fin n</code> indices. This code is often not just in the verification theorems but also in the code itself, either because it wants to use the non-panicking array indexing function <code>Array.get</code> or because some property is needed about the contents of the array (necessarily stated only over the elements actually in the array) in order to prove termination. Examples of this include <code>UnionFind</code> and <code>HashMap</code> from Std, as well as some larger software verification projects I've been working on, or most recently <a href=\"#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Checking.20the.20Goldbach.20conjecture/near/429974832\">this example</a> of doing proofs about do notation, which was supposed to be exemplary but ended up being something kind of embarrassing to show.</p>\n<p>Defining the type and operations should be relatively straightforward: I mean it to be exactly that subtype (or possibly a structure), and all operations are just filtered through. Code performance should be the same as Array, except that some functions pass <code>n</code> unnecessarily. Inlining should hopefully mitigate this issue.</p>\n<p>Another possible improvement is to use a representation that avoids duplicate information by not storing the length. However:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This would require changes to the runtime and compiler, and my sense is that this is a way to ensure it won't happen for 1+ year</li>\n<li>Although the title says \"Arrays with fixed length\", the length here isn't really \"fixed\", it's only counted externally; one can still have a <code>push</code> method and we do not want to lose the dynamic array doubling behavior, so keeping the capacity and length separate is desirable.</li>\n<li>The runtime does not have type information, so we need to store both capacity and length in the runtime value regardless, so that the right objects are destroyed when an array object is freed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding the name, I don't have any good ideas. <code>CArray A n</code> was used in the previous discussion on <a href=\"#narrow/stream/348111-std4/topic/Fin.20basics/near/369966462\">dependent arrays</a> (which is a separate thing).

You're right that <code>Subarray</code> is not a perfect alternative to fixed-length arrays.

The idea is to move the current <code>Array</code> to a more bare-bones type, probably unsafe, not for direct public consumption, that just handles memory storage operations. And then have the actual public <code>Array</code> be implemented more like <code>Subarray</code>, with more transparent operations where it is visible when a copy can or cannot happen and where operations like <code>set</code> transparently don't modify <code>size</code>.</p>\n<p>That said, this is along the same lines as Mario's \"Another possible improvement\" from above, so not for immediate consideration.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are also the issue that <code>Subarray</code> doesn't expose the length of the subarray as a parameter, which I don't think you'd want to have exposed that way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe this is what computed fields are for.</p>",

Which functions get <code>@[inline]</code> and <code>@[specialize]</code> etc. What do these attributes do?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>@[inline]</code> attribute should be applied to any def that is a thin wrapper for a lower level function. (Also special cases for performance issues but that's usually not to worry about until there is an actual performance issue.) Lean should probably do automatic inlining for many of those but that is not quite implemented yet as far as I know. (The backend does some of that automatically though.) When your def is a thin wrapper then you might want to make it an <code>abbrev</code>, which makes it both <code>@[inline]</code> and <code>@[reducible]</code> (and some extra kernel stuff). Sometimes <code>@[reducible]</code> is not desirable, then just do <code>@[inline]</code> instead of <code>abbrev</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>@[specialize]</code> attribute can be used when your def has a \"generic\" parameter. For example, in <code>Array.map</code> the function <code>f</code> is a generic parameter. The <code>@[specialize]</code> attribute instructs the compiler to generate a separate function for each instance of <code>f</code> (when that is possible). This should be used if  the primary use of the def is to be used repeatedly with the same generic parameter. This is not actually as common as you might think.</p>",
