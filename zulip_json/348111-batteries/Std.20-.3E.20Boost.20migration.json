(And indeed we think this is still the case even if it is done in two steps, at different times.) There will of course be user experience problems when people update their repositories, and this is what Mac will work on to make smoother.</p>\n<p>My recommendation is to move it <code>leanprover-community/boost</code> in a single step. I think this best reflects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>its open development model</li>\n<li>that the FRO isn't responsible for it</li>\n<li>and that future responsibility for its management ultimately lands with @admin team, rather than the Lean FRO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are still a bunch of open questions about boost (does it need additional maintainers? could it be split into smaller packages? should parts of it be folded back into Aesop/ProofWidgets/Mathlib? etc), but I'd prefer that we address those questions separately from the migration process, or at least afterwards, in particular because these are questions for the maintainers and the admin team, rather than the FRO.</p>",

Theoretical CS is in scope only insofar as it is useful for proving theorems about executable functions with practical application (e.g. automata theory used for correctness proofs of a regex engine). My guess is that theoretical CS for its own sake is better suited for mathlib (e.g. the <code>Computability/</code> folder), because it benefits more from having access to / contributing to the rest of the mathematical infrastructure there.</p>",
