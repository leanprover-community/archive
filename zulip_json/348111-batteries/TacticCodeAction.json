More specifically, the <code>lazy?</code> field will work in <code>IO</code>. The question is: how to access the current goal?  In this case I know <code>node</code> will give me <code>info : TacticInfo</code> and I have <code>info.goalsBefore</code> that a list of <code>MVarId</code>. I know I also have <code>ctx.runMetaM</code> but I don't know where to find a <code>LocalContext</code>to feed to that function. For instance how to write a code action that will simply take the current goal and output 'show ...<code> where </code>...` is the current goal (approximately) as displayed in the infoview.</p>",
