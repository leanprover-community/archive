For example <code>List Clause</code> is okay if you only ever need to fold the whole thing but would be absurdly inefficient for a SAT solver. So realistically the library would need to include something like <code>PersistentCnf</code> and <code>Cnf</code>, like <code>List</code> vs <code>Array</code>. But even then, what if you need a clause-database type representation which isn't an Array but some more specific data structure? I think the one thing we could all agree on is the mathematical model which would just be some inductive datatype of propositional formulas :)</p>",
