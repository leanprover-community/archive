        "content": "<p>(Sorry for the late reply.)  This postdoc fellowship is for the prestigious Goldstine Fellowship at IBM Research.  It is associated with the mathematics and theoretical computer science group at IBM Research.  This postdoc is fairly competitive.  Like postdocs in academics, it is best to have interests which align to the research of the group (and to trends in current research).  You can get a sense by looking at the previous Goldstine Fellows at the bottom of the link above.  If you have any questions feel free to DM me.</p>",
