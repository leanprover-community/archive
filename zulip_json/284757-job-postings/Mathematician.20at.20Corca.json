Our goal is to make mathematical writing both human-friendly and machine-interpretable, drawing on ideas from formalization and symbolic systems.</p>\n<p>We are a VC-backed, fully remote team of eight (with a small concentration in New York); the project started in aug 2023 with founders experiencing problems communicating math. We are looking for additional help from mathematicians with experience in the math formalization field. The scope of work is somewhat exploratory, so we can be flexible with engagement type — full-time, part-time, or project-based consulting.</p>\n<p>More details about the role are available here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://corca.app/doc/Fzv_v1ggpjDGRlEXq8mD6\">https://corca.app/doc/Fzv_v1ggpjDGRlEXq8mD6</a></p>\n<p>If this is of interest, we would be glad to speak further or answer any questions. My email is oleg[at]corca.io. </p>\n<p>Oleg</p>",
