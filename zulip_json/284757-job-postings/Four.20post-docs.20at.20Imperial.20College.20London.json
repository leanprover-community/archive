These are two-year positions starting on 1st October 2025 (i.e. in a couple of months!). Here's the ad link; deadline for applications is 15th Aug.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/search-jobs/description/index.php?jobId=24931&amp;jobTitle=Research+Associate+in+Formalization+of+Mathematics\">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/search-jobs/description/index.php?jobId=24931&amp;jobTitle=Research+Associate+in+Formalization+of+Mathematics</a></p>\n<p>Here's the reasons I think this is an important project:</p>\n<p>1) makes a hard target dataset for autoformalization methods;<br>\n2) forces us to formalize modern mathematical definitions which are being used today in theorems in the top journals.</p>\n<p>Ideally these definitions will end up in mathlib; the idea is that mathlib should contain material relevant to modern researchers across mathematics. Note that this is not a number-theory-specific job, I am looking for applicants with expertise across pure mathematics.</p>\n<p>Any questions feel free to email me or DM me here.</p>",
