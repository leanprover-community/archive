If you have unusual circumstances, please drop me a line sdedeo[at]andrew.cmu.edu</p>\n<p>For more information, please see <a href=\"https://proofsandreasons.io\">https://proofsandreasons.io</a> and/or the CMU postdoc application at <a href=\"https://cmu.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/CMU/details/Postdoctoral-Fellow---DeDeo-Lab---Dietrich-College_2023842?q=2023842\">https://cmu.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/CMU/details/Postdoctoral-Fellow---DeDeo-Lab---Dietrich-College_2023842?q=2023842</a></p>\n<p>If you have any questions, you are very welcome to ask here, and I'll reply when I get the ping.</p>\n<p>Best wishes from Pittsburgh,</p>\n<p>Simon</p>",
