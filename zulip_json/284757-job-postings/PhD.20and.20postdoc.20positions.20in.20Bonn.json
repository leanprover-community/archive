If you were considering to apply, but haven't yet, please do apply!</p>\n<p>There is also an update: the formalization group (led by me) can hire multiple people to join our group. Unfortunately, I cannot share the precise details yet. This is in addition to the department-wide positions. When applying, you're automatically applying to both options.<br>\nNote: for PhD students there will be another application round in March--April, which would still allow you to start in Fall 2026 (this option likely doesn't exist for postdocs).</p>",
