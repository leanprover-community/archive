A core component involves formalizing theoretical results and statistical guarantees in Lean4.</p>\n<p>I am seeking a paid research advisor (short-term, contract) to provide guidance and critical feedback on pre-existing theoretical work. The project is led by me and begins in an advisory capacity; authorship would only be discussed in the event of a substantive intellectual contribution to core results.</p>\n<p>Relevant background may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Signal processing</li>\n<li>Ergodic theory / dynamical systems</li>\n<li>Computational learning theory</li>\n<li>Abstract algebra (e.g., group actions, invariants)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EEG or neurotechnology experience is not required. Prior published work is a plus.</p>\n<p>Logistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Role: Part-time, paid advisory (independent contract)</li>\n<li>Rate: $55/hour (flexible depending on fit)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More details available via a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ra0gHJY9T41YIk9_d0AuseylYZSnwJgxqv9FfbVv_3I/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Doc</a>.<br>\nPlease send a DM if interested (GitHub Lean4 proofs or publications preferred).</p>",
