There are two possible directions to this work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>scaling up program verification using Lean by improving tactics, models and reasoning facilities -- this is the more language-oriented version of the internship</li>\n<li>using Lean to perform concrete program verification on real-world cryptographic implementations, e.g., proofs of functional correctness to show that this particular Montgomery or Barrett reduction in the implementation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyber\">ML-KEM</a> is correct given range hypotheses for the inputs -- this is the more math-oriented version of the internship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Concretely, the implementations will be written in the Rust programming language, and translated to Lean via the <a href=\"https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas\">Aeneas</a> toolchain for verification.</p>\n<p>Both of these aspects would be an excellent fit for a proficient Lean user, either more on the PL side, or on the math-user side.</p>\n<p>The internship is in the US, and Microsoft provides relocation assistance and visa support for international candidates. Any candidate must be currently enrolled in a PhD program.</p>",
