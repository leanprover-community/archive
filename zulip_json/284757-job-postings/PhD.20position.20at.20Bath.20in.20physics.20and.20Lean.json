However it is not expected that you have a background in all three of these areas. It is expected you will have a background in computer science, with a strong foundation in functional programming and mathematics, a background in theoretical physics with an interest in programming, <strong>or</strong> a background in mathematics with an interest in programming and physics.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions feel free to email me or dm me on here (preferred).
