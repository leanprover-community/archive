Research work will be conducted within the project “AI for Science”, under the supervision of <a href=\"https://kt.ijs.si/~ljupco/\">Ljupčo Todorovski</a>. Our research group at the Department of Mathematics comprises experts in formalized mathematics, machine learning, type theory, programming languages, and other topics in theoretical computer science.</p>\n<p>We are looking for candidates who are familiar with formalized mathematics and have strong interest in machine learning. Lack of background in machine learning can be offset with the desire to learn. The position is available for two years, with possibility of extension. The starting date is flexible, although we would prefer to have a candidate sooner rather than later. Please contact the principal investigator Ljupčo Todorovski at <a href=\"mailto:ljupco.todorovski@fmf.uni-lj.si\"><code>ljupco.todorovski@fmf.uni-lj.si</code></a> for further information.</p>",
