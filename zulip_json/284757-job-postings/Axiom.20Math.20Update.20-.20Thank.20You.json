We are Axiom Math - a Palo Alto based company and we are hiring too (different from the Axiomatic AI company - located in Boston - in the thread above).</p>\n<p>We are still in stealth mode, yet to be known by the public world, but we would love to chat with the Lean community prior to the official announcement and explore (1) having amazing candidates join our team as well as (2) hosting external open collaborations. Axiom recently closed a very large, competitive seed founding round (in the 50-100mm range) from top venture investors, and we have about 10 people - a small, world-class dream team in our 5300-sq-ft beautiful office. </p>\n<p>AI for mathematics is our one and only focus and priority. To this end, we are hiring Lean expert mathematicians, software engineers, and ML researchers for intern and full time positions. We offer top-of-market cash and equity packages. If you are interested in learning more about the opportunity (we will share more info at hiring chats), please get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:careers@axiommath.ai\">careers@axiommath.ai</a></p>\n<p>My email is <a href=\"mailto:carina@axiommath.ai\">carina@axiommath.ai</a> and feel free to drop a note to just say hello!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hi everyone, I want to thank you all for the overwhelming interest in Axiom - we have received so many awesome applications and as a small team we are currently processing the 1000+ applications we got. Thanks so much for reaching out and we are making sure to get back to everyone! Appreciate your patience - I look forward to continuing chatting with y’all and moving forward with next steps.</p>",
