The positions are initially for three years, after which an extension is likely to be possible. The suggested starting date is 1 October this year, but it is possible to start later. Please get in touch with Nicolai if you want to discuss possible start dates!</p>\n<p>The official advert is <a href=\"https://jobs.nottingham.ac.uk/vacancy.aspx?ref=SCI174425\">here</a>, and the closing date is 25 July. Please note that the university's application form is somewhat non-standard. There are very subject-specific questions (for example, asking you to demonstrate your experience with proof assistants) and text fields, but no obvious places to upload a CV or cover letter. You may use Section 5 (\"additional information\") to include the information you would usually add in a CV or cover letter. Please do not be discouraged by the subject-specific questions; it is not necessary to have experience with everything. Also note that the university asks for referee details per default; you do not need letters at the time you apply, you only need to list their contact details at this stage. Members of underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply.</p>\n<p>If you are interested, please get in touch with Nicolai.</p>",
