I'm writing a paper which would include my proof, but it is extensive and I'd rather not have readers of the paper have to each go through my proof.  I'd rather just provide the Lean proof to them.  I have the formulas for A(s) and B(s) in python, Latex, and Mathematica format.</p>\n<p>I'd like to get on a zoom call with you, explain the details of the functions to you (and show you my proof), and for you to tell me approximately what it would cost (time and $) for you to show that A(s)=B(s) using Lean.   I'll pay you 1/2 up front and 1/2 at the end.  If you are in the Seattle area, we can meet in person too, if you'd like.</p>",
