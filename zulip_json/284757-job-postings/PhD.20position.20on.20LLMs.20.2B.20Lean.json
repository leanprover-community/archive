One is traditional computational chemistry, but the other is quite relevant to the Lean community.</p>\n<p>This PhD student (Chemical Engineering or Computer Science) will join an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and linguists, to build an AI system for evaluating scientific claims. The ATOMS Lab brings experience in simulations and formal logic for science and engineering. This PhD student will learn to write proofs and programs in Lean 4, and will develop new ways to interface LLMs with logical reasoning tools.</p>\n<p>More details here, along with instructions to apply. If you have any questions, send me a DM on Zulip!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://atomslab.github.io/join/\">https://atomslab.github.io/join/</a></p>",
