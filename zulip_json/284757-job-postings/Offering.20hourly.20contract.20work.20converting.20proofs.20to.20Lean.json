Basically what it says on the tin; I often work with a theorem in a paper and wish to myself that I could have a Lean-ified version of it to sanity-check my understanding, and to test out variations. I'd love to have someone who I can pay to produce such proofs! These theorems are often relatively small and simple, and so I don't think it would necessarily take tons of hours to e.g. encode all the background math into mathlib.</p>\n<p>You can message me about it here, although I'm more likely to see your message if you email me at <a href=\"mailto:alexanderaltair@gmail.com\">alexanderaltair@gmail.com</a></p>",
