I am looking for motivated and capable students with a strong interest in Programming Languages and Verification (<a href=\"https://ista.ac.at/en/research/sammler-group/\">https://ista.ac.at/en/research/sammler-group/</a>).</p>\n<p>The research of my group centers around the theoretical and practical challenges of verifying realistic low-level code, with a focus on verification techniques based on proof assistants like Lean and Rocq and separation logics like Iris. Concrete projects of the group are the <a href=\"https://plv.mpi-sws.org/refinedc/\">RefinedC verification tool</a> for C, the <a href=\"https://plv.mpi-sws.org/dimsum/\">DimSum framework</a> for multi-language semantics and verification, or work on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean\">Iris-Lean</a>. If any of these sound interesting, I encourage you to apply.</p>\n<p>ISTA offers internationally competitive salaries, full health benefits, and subsidized on-campus housing in the first year. Students with a bachelor’s or master’s degree in a relevant field are encouraged to apply. The deadline for PhD applications is <strong>January 8, 2026</strong> for a start date in September 2026 (or earlier, if desired).</p>\n<p>Applications should be submitted through <a href=\"https://phd.ista.ac.at/\">https://phd.ista.ac.at/</a>. If you apply, please also drop me a note at <a href=\"mailto:michael.sammler@ista.ac.at\">michael.sammler@ista.ac.at</a> so I am aware of your application. Feel free to reach out to me via email or Zulip for more information or visit <a href=\"https://phd.ista.ac.at/\">https://phd.ista.ac.at/</a>.</p>",
