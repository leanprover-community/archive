Formalization and Lean are explicitly mentioned in one of the two position's descriptions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aalto.fi/en/open-positions/postdoctoral-researchers-in-mathematics-in-probabilistic-and-algebraic-approaches-to-quantum-field\">CALL TEXT</a><ul>\n<li>review of applications begins <time datetime=\"2026-01-01T08:00:00Z\">2026-01-01T10:00:00+02:00</time> and call closes <time datetime=\"2026-01-31T21:59:00Z\">2026-01-31T23:59:00+02:00</time></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The text does not mention a specific formalization project for two reasons: (1) these are still primarily traditional postdoctoral researcher positions in mathematics, and (2) to the extent that formalization would be involved, I believe it will be more fruitful to commit to a larger project only after an assessment of different projects' realistic participants. But rest assured that I value past formalization achievements as well as mathematical ones (and Shinji also does).</p>",
