        "content": "<p>Hi Everyone,</p>\n<p>I am currently recruiting a PhD student at King's College London to work at the intersection of formalising mathematics, theoretical CS, and formal verification. The project is about the verification of statistical model checking (SMC) algorithms which reason about models of probabilisitic systems, like Markov Decision Processes. The project accommodates anything from the formalisation (in Isabelle, Lean, etc) of the theory behind SMC to the formal verification of efficient executable SMC programs.</p>\n<p>The project is funded by STaR-AI (Home fee status only): King’s Prize Doctoral Programme in Safe, Trusted and Responsible Artificial Intelligence. It will be co-supervised by Mohammad Abdulaziz from the Department of Informatics (<a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mohammad-abdulaziz\">https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mohammad-abdulaziz</a>) and John Armstrong from the Department of Mathematics (<a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/john-armstrong\">https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/john-armstrong</a>).</p>\n<p>Deadline: 2 March</p>\n<p>More information about the project: <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/formal-verification-of-statistical-model-checking-algorithms/?p193686\">https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/formal-verification-of-statistical-model-checking-algorithms/?p193686</a></p>\n<p>Apply here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/star-ai\">https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/star-ai</a></p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me (<a href=\"mailto:mohammad.abdulaziz@kcl.ac.uk\">mohammad.abdulaziz@kcl.ac.uk</a>) or John Armstrong (<a href=\"mailto:john.armstrong@kcl.ac.uk\">john.armstrong@kcl.ac.uk</a>) if you are interested!</p>",
