As models grow more capable and opaque, the need for provable correctness has become more urgent. We're building the platform to make formal verification a core part of the AI loop.</p>\n<p>We're looking for exceptional engineers and researchers who are fluent in Lean4 and want to help push the boundaries of what verified reasoning systems can do in practice. This is a founding engineer role, you'll be joining a world-class team from Stanford, IITs, Google, DeepMind, and Meta AI, backed by distinguished angels, all united by the belief that the next leap in trustworthy AI will come from verified reasoning.</p>\n<p>If this resonates with you, DM me, we'd love to chat.</p>",
