Often, this is a matter of implicit side conditions in problem statements, that require a subtle reading to decide how to formalise correctly and fairly. Moreover, there is simply a lot of theory to formalise before you can even state geometry problems, relative to combinatorial or algebraic problems at IMO level. Joseph has been doing this!</p>",
