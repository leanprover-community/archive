All definitions needed for IMO 2025 P2 were present (since I'd added definitions relating to tangency during the past year) without any workarounds for missing definitions being needed. In general terms, the main missing definitions needed for significant proportions of past IMO and IMO shortlist geometry problems relate to angle bisectors, polygons and arcs of circles. (Looking at the IMO 2024 shortlist geometry problems, for example, G2 (= P4), G7 and G8 can now be expressed cleanly, while definitions should still be added for stating G1, G2, G4, G5 and G6.) I hope to add more such definitions in future, but my current series of PRs (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/26530\">#26530</a> etc) are oriented more to adding enough <code>incenter</code> API to start on the solution to 2024 P4, rather than on definitions now the main <code>incenter</code>-related definitions have been added. (I think the most convenient form of lemmas relating <code>incenter</code> to angle bisectors for solving problems in two dimensions is probably not the same as one involving explicit bisector definitions for <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(n-1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">−</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>-dimensional oriented subspaces for the faces of a simplex in <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span> dimensions that describes the relation in <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span>-dimensional generality.)</p>",
