I’m new here myself, and certainly don’t claim any moral authority, but - as someone who is a leery eyed skeptic of everything “Open”AI - I found this behavior to be <em>especially</em>  distasteful. So much so, that I did some deeper digging into all this and came across this fantastic, underground community that I never knew existed! Warms my heart to see so many taking the high ground here :)</p>",
