I've now set up a web page <a href=\"https://www.imo-register.org.uk/papers/\">https://www.imo-register.org.uk/papers/</a> to collect scans of the actual pre-2006 papers given to contestants to make the original wording more accessible, and welcome contributions of more such scans (in all languages, though with a particular focus on getting the original English versions where available). So far I've just put up a few such scans where I already had copies of the original papers available: 1995 (English, French), 1994 (English), 1981 (English), 1979 (most languages, but missing English day 1, Russian day 1, Spanish day 2, which had gone astray from David Monk's file at some point before I scanned it in 2010), 1971 (English).</p>",
