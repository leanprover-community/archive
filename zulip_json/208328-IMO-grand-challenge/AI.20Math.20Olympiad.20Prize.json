(Is it because the test set is hidden?) Couldn't we easily end up in the situation where there are 100 sub-models?  Each model does better on a different type of IMO problem.  Teams realizing they are not quite there, start to combine into super teams where they aggregate all their models.  There are a lot of hard coded solutions for particular common types of problems.  There is very complicated and ad hoc logic to decide what model to use in each situation and what solution to send to the reviewers.  Of course complexity can be fine.  Alpha-fold 2 is quite complex.  But I think high prize money could lead to a kitchen-sink approach where everything is thrown in.</p>",

Otherwise (if there are inequalities involved), you need quantifier elimination, which is much less efficient.</p>\n<p>A large proportion of IMO geometry problems do in fact involve configuration or nondegeneracy information that prevents them reducing to Gröbner bases. For example, IMO 2023 problem 2 asks to prove that two points meet on an internal angle bisector (the polynomials in question won't distinguish internal from external bisectors, and indeed a similar issue applies to the definition of the point S). IMO 2023 problem 6 asks to prove that circles have two common points, which polynomials won't distinguish from having a single common point.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the relevant information in the conclusion, beyond what can be deduced with Gröbner bases, may be geometrically obvious and not need remarking on in a human solution, but that's not always the case. In IMO 2023 problem 6 you could lose points for not justifying various nondegeneracy conditions needed in a solution. In IMO 2002 problem 2 you could lose a point for failing to explain why an angle condition meant you had the incentre rather than an excentre.</p>\n<p>Even if you don't have such configuration information in the conclusion, you might need to use such information from the hypotheses. Maybe the polynomials generate an ideal that contains polynomial <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">PQ</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">PQ</span></span></span></span>, but actually you have to prove something equivalent to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">P=0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">P</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span></span></span></span>, and excluding the possibility of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">Q=0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">Q</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span></span></span></span> with <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\">≠</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">P\\ne 0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">P</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\"><span class=\"mrel\"><span class=\"mord vbox\"><span class=\"thinbox\"><span class=\"rlap\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"inner\"><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mrel\"></span></span></span><span class=\"fix\"></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span></span></span></span> requires using nondegeneracy conditions from the problem statement, for example.
