But we know the IMO have already verified that the solutions from GDM are gold level. So if we did want to toy with the idea of incorporating closed source models that don’t use lean…GDM did announce that they will be inviting select mathematicians to demo this model before its public release. In that case, maybe not a bad idea for Kevin and co to link up  and  get their hands on the model? I’m sure Demis and GDM would be more than happy to accommodate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1947337617231778168?s=46\">https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1947337617231778168?s=46</a></p>",
