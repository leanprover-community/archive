        "content": "<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>Following the discussion in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"287929\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Labelled.20Transition.20Systems.20.28LTS.29/with/524255270\">#mathlib4 &gt; Labelled Transition Systems (LTS)</a>, last month I created a mathlib-based 'cs library' and started porting reusable definitions from the more specialised formalisation projects at our research group. It has a rather general name for now (<code>cslib</code>), as discussed in the original topic here on Zulip, since the point is to provide general definitions and theorems that can be used in other CS libraries. The initial code and documentation pipeline are now in place:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/cs-lean/cslib\">https://github.com/cs-lean/cslib</a></li>\n<li>Docs: <a href=\"https://cs-lean.github.io/\">https://cs-lean.github.io/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One aim is to provide model/language-agnostic APIs, which could be interesting for (including but not limited to) concurrency theory, compilers, database theory, distributed algorithms, logic, model checking, programming languages, etc. So we've started by formalising a big part of the textbook 'Introduction to Bisimulation and Coinduction' by Sangiorgi. See, for example, <a href=\"https://cs-lean.github.io/Cslib/Semantics/LTS/Basic.html\">https://cs-lean.github.io/Cslib/Semantics/LTS/Basic.html</a> and <a href=\"https://cs-lean.github.io/Cslib/Semantics/LTS/Bisimulation.html\">https://cs-lean.github.io/Cslib/Semantics/LTS/Bisimulation.html</a>.<br>\nAs textbook exercises, there are definitions of Milner's CCS (as defined in the intro to bisimulation textbook, including a proof that bisimilarity is a congruence) and Girard's linear logic. There are also some well-known results, like some characterisations of weak bisimilarity and the equality of bisimilarity and trace equivalence for deterministic LTSs.</p>\n<p>There are already two formalisation efforts based on the library (<a href=\"https://www.chords.dev/\">https://www.chords.dev/</a>, where among other things we're making a choreographic programming language with a certified compiler, and the code of a course we teach at our uni), which are in sync with the library. We hope that more can find this useful, and in particular see value in keeping some sort of API compatibility when it comes to similar things.</p>\n<p>It might be that there are benefits in merging this with other efforts (I've noticed a parallel channel <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"513188\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/513188-CSLib\">#CSLib</a> has started since the discussion in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"287929\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Labelled.20Transition.20Systems.20.28LTS.29/with/524255270\">#mathlib4 &gt; Labelled Transition Systems (LTS)</a>; I'll try to look into it), connecting to other libs (<a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"490604\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/490604-iris-lean\">#iris-lean</a>?), refocusing this (more aimed at programming, logic, and semantics?), and/or putting it under leanprover-community (mentioned this to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> some time ago). So, comments are welcome and, if you're interested, please do reach out. :) For now, we're at the stage of 'getting stuff out there' whenever we find some time (currently not a whole lot given the upcoming summer holidays!).</p>",

I think we should have a syntax*, which people can then use as basis to formalise all sorts of different evaluation strategies and theorems about them. We should try to have generic signatures for what a 'reduction semantics' is, etc., just like for LTSs. In fact, the LTS.toRel def we already have is designed for the usual 'a reduction semantics is an LTS with only \\tau-labels'.</p>\n<p>*: There are multiple ways even to define syntax, as you note. I think the different approaches could live in the same library. For example, the standard pen-and-paper with free/bound names and alpha-renaming, the abstract syntax approach, etc. Thus enabling people to show transformations between those.</p>",

My main interest is to formalize some of the theory of automata on infinite words, while the automata theory in mathlib is concerned only with finite words.  I also found the automata theory in mathlib not very convenient for my purpose.  For example, the meaning of accepting states in automata on infinite words is very different from that in automata on finite words and the two need to be treated in different ways in some automata constructions.  So it is more convenient for me to not include accepting states as part of an automaton as is done in mathlib's automata theory.  I also try to treat the two types of automata in as uniform a way as possible and in many cases the same automata construction is used to prove the same or similar properties of automata on finite words and autamota on infinite words.  For example, the same \"loop\" construction on automata is used to show that regular languages are closed under Kleene star and the ω-power of a regular language is an ω-regular language, even though the former result is already in mathlib.</p>",

Those properties are robust and do not depend on the details of the automata or LTS that are used to define them.  (For example, the notion of regular languages can be defined using either deterministic or nondeterministic automata and the latter can support or not support epsilon transitions and have a single initial state or allow multiple initial states.). Of course, one has to pick a particular definition and work with it.  But the particular details of the definition are not ultimately interesting.</p>",
