We could call it <code>LogicalEqv</code> or similar. In addition to giving access to the notation \\==, this class could require to prove some theorems. For example, under a given proof system (like <code>Proof</code> in CLL), one would expect that logical equivalence supports a substitution/congruence principle.</p>",
