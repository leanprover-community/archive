First, <code>moreServerArgs</code> is not a project-specific option, it is a workspace-global one (workspace configuration is simply inherited from the root package), and this is by design . In many cases, this is what is desired (i.e.,  if a user sets <code>pp.unicode_fun=true</code>, they probably want to see it in dependent packages as well). Second, global server options were originally a design decision of the <code>lean --server</code>, not Lake. If you were to skip Lake entirely and run <code>lean --server -DautoImplicit=false</code>, you would get the same behavior.  Finally, <code>moreLeanArgs</code> is the package-specific option. Where the feature proposed here to be added, it would use those <em>plus</em> <code>moreServerArgs</code> of the workspace to instantiate file workers based on where the package the file resides. However, the Lean server currently does not support per-file-worker arguments, so that cannot be done without a significant change in design.</p>",
