We've had some discussions in the past and Mario said that it would be good to have this functionality available for <code>std4</code> as well. So I thought of having the <code>Cache</code> code placed at <code>std4</code> instead. So <code>mathlib4</code> would inherit it. There are, of course, some gotchas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Cache</code> would also require a configuration file (<code>cache-manifest.json</code> or smth) that would contain, among other information, the URL of the host endpoint</li>\n<li>We would need another Azure blob to store <code>std4</code> cache</li>\n<li><code>mathlib4</code> wouldn't be able to use <code>std4</code> cache files as I originally intended</li>\n<li>Running <code>cache</code> for the first time without a configuration file set would prompt a smart menu to configure one.
