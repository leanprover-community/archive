As I am still working on the proof of  continuous version of MCT, by showing first: 1) the Doob &amp; Snell's upcrossing inequality and 2) Bernstein &amp; Lévy's maximum inequalities (9.18 and 9.16 in Kallenberg 2021, respectively). Precisely, I've started working on 1. during the ItaLean2025 and I continue now. Could I please have a task for 1 and claim it? Say, \"Doob's upcrossing inequality for a countable index\" ?</p>",
