        "content": "<p>We have reached the goal of the project, which was to define a Brownian motion. Now we are moving it to Mathlib, and we will also need to write a paper about it, but the \"proving theorems in Lean\" part is done.<br>\nSeveral people have expressed to me their willingness to contribute and their surprise that the project was done so quickly and that they did not have time to join. These people are not busy with making PRs to Mathlib and are presumably still looking for a project, so I propose that we start a second phase of the project, which will be slower, less guided but more collaborative.</p>\n<h3>Let me first reflect on how the project worked in its first phase</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>with Peter, we discussed the goal of the project and the path we should take towards that goal 2 years ago. Peter wrote a short document to detail the proof.  It was meant as our private formalization project but we had other commitments and it did not move forward. </li>\n<li>3 weeks before the project became public, we decided to open it to external collaboration and in preparation I started writing a detailed blueprint (around 40 pages): first list every lemma and link them correctly in the graph (with proofs for most of them), then write all the Lean definitions, and finally for most lemmas on the Kolmogorov-Chentsov side I wrote Lean statements (by copying the latex into a docstring, waiting for copilot to propose a statement, then fixing it... it was not perfect, but I needed it to not take ages). The Gaussian side was less detailed because I expected people to be familiar with the standard objects used there. That was not a full time job for 3 weeks, but I spend a few hours whenever I could to advance the blueprint.</li>\n<li>after the start of the main phase of the project, the Lean formalization proceeded quickly thanks to an amazing dedication of several contributors, and in 3 weeks we were done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My main point is that the preparation took as long as the project, and I presume it's mostly because it was not collaborative. Perhaps the blueprint was too detailed and I could have gone faster, perhaps the public phase of the project should have started while the blueprint was in construction. The bottom line is that I am not willing to write a second blueprint document for a next phase of the project right now, but I'd like to try a more experimental and collaborative way to use the leanblueprint framework.</p>\n<h3>Next phase of the project</h3>\n<p>I propose we target <strong>Itô's lemma</strong> for the stochastic integral (for which we don't have a definition yet). It's theorem 18.18 in Kallenberg's Foundations of Modern Probability (3rd ed.). We will need several new definitions and many intermediate results. In practice that means that we need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discuss that goal. Perhaps there is a better goal for the next phase of the project.</li>\n<li>find the key results that we need on the way</li>\n<li>start new sections of the blueprint. First write the big theorems and definitions, then add intermediate lemmas as needed. It's important to add links for the dependency graph. Working on the blueprint is the same as working on the code: just fork the repo and open a PR.</li>\n<li>discuss and add Lean definitions.</li>\n<li>prove everything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A last point: during the first phase, I intentionally used a collaboration model in which people coordinate by talking in a zulip topic to know what's claimed and what remains to be done. That's suitable for a small number of collaborators who follow the project closely and needs the continuous involvement of someone who posts updated claim lists, which was the contribution model I was looking for. However it's not great for new people who are just looking for something small to prove. For a longer, more open project, we might need to switch to github issues.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Does that sound like a nice project?</p>",

Note that I am not an expect in that field, so don't hesitate to correct errors, suggest a better approach, or do any other required change.<br>\n For now the chapter contains only a list of definitions (some of which are of the form \"there exists a process such that\" and require big theorems). All of that needs proofs, and lemmas extracted from those proofs, until we have many small results, each of which could correspond to one Lean def/lemma.</p>\n<p>A concrete and relatively simple result that one could already prove is Doob's Lp inequality for non-negative sub-martingales, which should be a consequence of this: <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Probability/Martingale/OptionalStopping.html#MeasureTheory.maximal_ineq\">MeasureTheory.maximal_ineq</a>. I thought we proved it years ago with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243312\">@Kexing Ying</span> , but apparently not.</p>\n<p>Something else we need to figure out is Stieltjes integrals (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue%E2%80%93Stieltjes_integration\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue%E2%80%93Stieltjes_integration</a>, <a href=\"https://dec41.user.srcf.net/h/III_L/stochastic_calculus_and_applications/1\">https://dec41.user.srcf.net/h/III_L/stochastic_calculus_and_applications/1</a>). In Mathlib we have the fact that a monotone right continuous function defines a measure (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Stieltjes.html#StieltjesFunction.measure\">StieltjesFunction.measure</a>), so we can integrate against those. We'll also need to get a signed measure from a function of locally bounded variation. We know from <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/EMetricSpace/BoundedVariation.html#LocallyBoundedVariationOn.exists_monotoneOn_sub_monotoneOn\">LocallyBoundedVariationOn.exists_monotoneOn_sub_monotoneOn</a> that such a function is a difference of monotone functions. If we add some continuity properties to that we could define the signed measure as the difference of the two Stieltjes measures of the monotone functions. And then there is the issue that we don't have a definition of an integral against a signed measure.</p>",
