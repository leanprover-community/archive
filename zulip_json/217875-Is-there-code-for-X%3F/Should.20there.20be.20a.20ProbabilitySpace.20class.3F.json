However there are fewer barriers than there were 6 years ago, when there was no documentation for any of the systems which was suitable for mathematicians, and Q&amp;As were mostly being done with email mailing lists (so nothing in real time). Asking many questions on the Lean chatroom (first Gitter, now Zulip) seemed to be the only way into the subject at the time, and those of us who were around back then are still extremely grateful to the computer scientists who spent a lot of time answering our basic questions. </p>\n<p>It's very helpful to hear suggestions about how the software can be made easier for mathematicians, because there certainly exist people who are not prepared to expose their ignorance on Zulip, or would rather learn by reading something than asking questions. For questions like this, I am hoping that they will go away over time as mathlib's coverage of basic notions gets better, and more worked examples appear online explaining how to do basic stuff. Mathematics In Lean <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/\">#mil</a> is an attempt to do this, but mathematics is a big subject and there are still plenty of gaps.</p>",

In my ideal world, random variables would not be modeled by a single sample space, but on something resembling an element of a filter on the category of all sample spaces, and then independent copies of random variables could be introduced by restricting to a smaller element of this filter; one would almost never touch the sample space directly except for some foundational lemmas, and manipulate random variables almost exactly like how one already manipulates deterministic quantities.

Frequently I will be having a random variable <code>X : Ω → S</code> and a positive probability event <code>E : Set Ω</code>, and I will wish to create a new conditioned random variable <code>(X|E) : E → S</code> formed by conditioning <code>X</code> to <code>E</code>, which I would like to also endow with the structure of a probability space. So the sample space and the probability measure will change repeatedly, and is not something I can handle as a global <code>variable</code>.  (This is in order to be able to state and prove the entropy chain rule <code>H[X,Y] = H[Y] + H[X|Y]</code>, where <code>H[X|Y]</code> is defined as <code>∑ y, P[ Y = y ] H[ (X|Y=y) ]</code>, and then go on to prove the Shannon entropy inequalities and thence on to my actual application.)</p>\n<p>I think I'm still going to try to make the <code>ProbabilitySpace</code> class approach work for now.  I still need to figure out how to artificially handle this conditioning when the event <code>E</code> has probability zero (or is not measurable at all) but apart from that technical issue I think I can see how it is going to work for my application.  [Note that this sort of conditioning is not exactly the same as conditioning to a sub-sigma-algebra, which is what seems to be what is currently supported in Mathlib.]</p>",

I guess you would prefer to have one single assumption instead of two for psychological reasons, but in practice it doesn't make any difference. These assumptions will typically be in a <code>variable</code> block in the top of your file, written there once and for all, so they won't clutter your statements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm <em>not</em> going to be working with a single probability space and a single measure; there will be a <em>lot</em> of them.  A typical thing that will happen for instance in my application is that I will start with two random variables <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> on a probability space <code>Ω</code> with some raw measure <code>volume</code>, and I will start to need to consider the conditioned random variables <code>(X|Y=y)</code> defined on a conditioned probability space <code>Y⁻¹'({y})</code> with the restricted volume measure (and later, I will be taking conditional independent trials, and other various constructions).  I can't just choose a single ambient sample space and set it as a global <code>variable</code>, and so with the orthodox approach I <em>am</em> going to encounter a lot of clutter in my notation.  For instance, I will frequently be summing over <code>y</code> expressions such as <code>P [ Y = y ] H[ X | Y = y ]</code> that involve random variables on different probability spaces (I am vaguely worried about the \"dependent type hell\" alluded to earlier that this will entail, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it).</p>",

At some point I will prove the Shannon inequality <code>H[ X, Y ] ≤ H[ X ] + H[ Y ]</code> whenever <code>X : Ω → S</code>,  <code>Y : Ω → T</code> are two random variables (taking values in some finite sets <code>S T</code>).  From this inequality I want to deduce the conditional counterpart <code>H[ X, Y | Z ] ≤ H[ X | Z ] + H[ Y | Z ]</code>, where <code>Z : Ω → U</code> is some further random variable.  The natural way to do this is to expand <code>H[ X, Y | Z ] = ∑ z : U, P[ Z = z ] * H[ X, Y | Z = z ]</code>, and similarly for <code>H[ X | Z ]</code> and <code>H[ Y | Z ]</code>.  One then applies the unconditional Shannon inequality for the conditioned random variables <code>(X | Z = z)</code>, <code>(Y | Z = z)</code> for each <code>z : U</code>, and then the conditional inequality will follow from <code>gcongr</code>.  Note here it will be convenient to permit conditioning even if the event <code>Z=z</code> has zero measure.  </p>\n<p>In expressions such as <code>∑ z : U, P[ Z = z ] * H[ X, Y | Z = z ]</code>, multiple probability spaces and probability measures are in play, and I would prefer to not have to explicitly note all this data in my notation.  I believe that a <code>ProbabilitySpace</code> class will handle this nicely (for instance, the <code>P[ ]</code> notation already defined does not make explicit reference to the measure).  I don't see how to easily express assertions such as <code>H[ X, Y | Z ] = ∑ z : U, P[ Z = z ] * H[ X, Y | Z = z ]</code> in a lemma just using global <code>variable</code>s.</p>",

An analogous argument applies in the case of most theoretical CS folks for functional analysis / measure theory /infinite graphs or anything more advanced than very basic abstract algebra. Although a fraction of the community working in ML theory is quite comfortable with measure theoretic analysis and many of us have math backgrounds, just uttering those words could be enough to send most people  in an algorithms or complexity theory group running away (jokes aside they'll ask you to describe stuff in elementary ways). Most of the math we work with can be taught to students right out of high school.</p>",
