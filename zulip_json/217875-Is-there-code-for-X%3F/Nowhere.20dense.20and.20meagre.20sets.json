The real reason we haven't fixed that yet is that filters of sets are <strong><em>everywhere</em></strong> in topology in Mathlib. So when the general definition was added (<a href=\"https://tqft.net/mathlib4files/Mathlib/Order/PFilter\">file#Mathlib/Order/PFilter</a> says in 2020, 3 years after <a href=\"https://tqft.net/mathlib4files/Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic\">file#Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic</a>), there was already a <em>lot</em> of APIs about this special case, and no one was sufficiently interested in the general case to really develop its API (I don't even think there was a consensus that unifying was the right thing to do). I'm now convinced that we should do it at some point because a few people have already complained for the lack of API in the general case, but I'm not even sure how much actually generalizes. For sure the lattice structure does, but what about <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=FIlter.map#doc\">docs#FIlter.map</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Filter.comap#doc\">docs#Filter.comap</a> ?</p>",
