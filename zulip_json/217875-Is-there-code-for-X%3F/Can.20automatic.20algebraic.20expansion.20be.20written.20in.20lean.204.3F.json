But you must understand that Lean is doing things differently than a CAS, because it has to prove them. So, for example, using the <code>ring</code> tactic to should that <code>(x + y + z)  ^ 10</code> is equal to its expansion (which <code>ring</code> won't compute for you), is <em>much</em> slower than something that simply computes the expansion. This is because <code>ring</code> is generating a proof term on the fly, and a CAS is not burdened by such things.</p>\n<p>You could write very fast Lean code that computes polynomial expansions, but simultaneously producing a proof of correctness is much harder.</p>",
