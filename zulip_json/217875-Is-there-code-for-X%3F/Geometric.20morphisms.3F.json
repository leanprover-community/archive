I think that the challenge is to prove the extension properties for functors (Diaconescu's theorem) for promoting flat functors on sites to geometric morphisms, which is how (in my experience) you construct geometric morphisms. (there are also other ways to promote functors on sites to geometric morphisms)</p>",
