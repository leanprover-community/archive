In the proof I need to use the evenly covered property and by rewriting things I got the homomorphism. In lean it's PartialHomeomorph.  I suppose I need to use injectivity to do this part: </p>\n<p><span class=\"tex-error\">Indeed, by construction \\[ p_{| \\bar{U}} \\circ \\tilde{f}_1 |_{V} = p_{| \\bar{U}} \\circ \\tilde{f}_2 |_{V}. \\] Since \\( p_{| \\bar{U}} \\) is a homeomorphism, it follows that \\[ \\tilde{f}_1 |_{V} = \\tilde{f}_2 |_{V}. \\]</span></p>\n<p>However,  I can only prove that (↑ph (f₁.f_lift v)).1 = (↑ph (f₂.f_lift v)).1 since the condition I have is ∀ p_1 ∈ ph.source, (↑ph p_1).1 = p p_1. When it comes to proving (↑ph (f₁.f_lift v)).2 = (↑ph (f₂.f_lift v)).2, I didn't find any conditions obtained with PartialHomeomorph related to this second output. <br>\nSo my question is: what second output, how is it defined? Or am I using the correct way (PartialHomeomorph.injOn) to prove it?</p>",
