Right now it seems like there are many lemmas about manifolds with boundary that might best be understood as falling under the theory of Thom spaces.</p>\n<p>One of those sources is the thread about model spaces, in which a key lemma concerns invariance of domain. Invariance of domain follows from Spanier-Whitehead duality concerning the Thom space of a stable normal bundle of a manifold.</p>\n<p>In the case of a sphere immersed in a sphere this subsumes invariance of domain implying that ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ are not homeomorphic for n and m distinct.</p>\n<p>A complete point of view for that theory seems just as important as the eventual completion of the thread concerning Chern classes, while giving organizing principles for the boundaries of smooth manifolds.</p>\n<p>I thought it could be a good idea to discuss that in a theead of its own. Maybe we can collect progress here- even though it is far off, even the basic result of the inverse function theorem requires invariance of domain in the proof of openness. This result has its natural place in Alexander and Spanier-Whitehead duality, in which complements of submanifolds are related to the Thom space of a normal bundle.</p>",

If \"Space\" means \"simplicial set\", then it is ok. If \"Space\" means \"topological space\", it might be wrong. In the category of topological spaces, if <code>T</code> is compact, it is unclear to me that <code>Hom(T, -)</code> commutes with filtered colimits.

The <code>n</code>th homotopy group functor of (pointed) simplicial sets commutes with filtered colimits (I have formalised this for Kan complexes, and with some more work, it will also hold for arbitrary simplicial sets), but it is unclear it works for arbitrary filtered colimits of topological spaces. Currently, we are not even remotely able to formalize homotopy colimits, but it is true that the homotopy groups of a filtered hocolim identify to the colimit of the homotopy groups (because it shall be true in the category of simplicial sets, and then also in a Quillen-equivalent category...). In any case, results about homotopy colimits seem to be quite irrelevant to the topic of this thread.</p>",
