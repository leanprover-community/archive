Examples of what it does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It changes the example that started this discussion, <code>A ∪ B ⊆ C</code> (where <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> have type <code>Set X</code>), into <code>∀ ⦃a : X⦄, a ∈ A ∪ B → a ∈ C</code>.</li>\n<li>It changes <code>a ∈ A ∪ B</code> into <code>a ∈ A ∨ a ∈ B</code>.</li>\n<li>It changes <code>a ∣ b</code> (where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are integers) into <code>∃ (c : ℤ), b = a * c</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The function that does most of the work of my tactic is similar to <code>whnf</code>.  (In fact, I think a tactic that simply called <code>whnf </code>on an expression would do a pretty good job of writing out definitions.)  The function repeatedly calls <code>Lean.Meta.whnfCore</code> and <code>Lean.Meta.unfoldDefinition?</code>.  At each step, it does some additional checks.  Perhaps most significantly, it checks to see if the expression has the form \"not (something)\".  If so, it leaves the \"not\" there and tries to write out the definition of \"something.\"  As a result, not only will it change <code>a ∈ A ∪ B</code> into <code>a ∈ A ∨ a ∈ B</code>, it will also change <code>a ∉ A ∪ B</code> into <code>¬(a ∈ A ∨ a ∈ B)</code>.  There are also special checks to prevent certain unfoldings that could be confusing to beginners.  For example, \"if-then-else\" statements unfold to something unreadable, so they don't get unfolded.  A statement of the form <code>x ∈ A</code> would unfold to <code>A x</code>, so this unfolding is prevented.</p>",
