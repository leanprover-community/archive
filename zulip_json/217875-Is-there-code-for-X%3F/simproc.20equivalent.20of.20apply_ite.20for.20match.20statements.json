Is there a way to do this within a single <code>simp</code> invocation, in the same way that <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=apply_ite#doc\">docs#apply_ite</a> can do this for <code>if</code>s within <code>simp</code>?</p>\n<p>I can do this by writing down a version of <code>apply_ite</code> specialised to the particular type I'm matching over, but it is a bit sad to do so. I'm imagining that it would have to be a simproc, since presumably one can't write down a lemma that understands all the different kinds of matches.</p>",
