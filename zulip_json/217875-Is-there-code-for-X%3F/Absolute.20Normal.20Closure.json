But <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=IsNormalClosure#doc\">docs#IsNormalClosure</a> does not appear to come with such a construction. I suppose it's something like<code>IntermediateField.normalClosure F K (AlgebraicClosure K)</code>, but of course that won't have API. Am I missing something, or is \"<code>NormalClosure</code>\" not yet in Mathlib?</p>",
