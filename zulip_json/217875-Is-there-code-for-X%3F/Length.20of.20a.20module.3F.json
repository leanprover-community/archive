I worked on some API for lengths of modules in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/22127\">#22127</a> using an approach which requires some refactoring of Relseries stuff to make work as nicely as I thought it would. In that thread, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"439483\">@Andrew Yang</span>  gave some code detailing an alternate approach which makes better use of the existing API, and we decided it would be best to pursue this method for getting module lengths into mathlib. PRs  <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21800\">#21800</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21803\">#21803</a> are developing some of the material used here, and once these are merged in I think we should be pretty close to having lengths of modules and some nice api for them</p>",
