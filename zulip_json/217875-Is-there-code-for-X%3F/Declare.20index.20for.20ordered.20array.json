I'd like to know if, given a list or array called div, there is a convenient notation to declare an index for that array.  Also, I would like to know how to define the property that the given array is ordered, i.e. given indices i &gt; j we have div[i]&gt;div[j].</p>\n<p>Update: I found the answer in the arrays section of the lean manual, which says that you can declare an index with i : Fin div.size.  However, when I try to use this as an index, I have encountered an error saying that I must prove that this index is in bounds, which should be obvious from its definition.  So I am still confused.</p>",
