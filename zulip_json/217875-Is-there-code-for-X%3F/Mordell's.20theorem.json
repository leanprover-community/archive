I have an algorithm: I tend to not respond to people who are using a pseudonym and I don't look at the channel when I'm busy, but if I'm not busy and the question is clearly in good faith by someone wanting to learn, and if I know the answer, then why not answer? This is how I learnt Lean myself (and back then the community only had 20 or so regulars in it!) and I won't forget that. Now there are many many people answering questions there so it's not like you're sucking up one person's time. Ask as many beginner questions as you like there!</p>",
