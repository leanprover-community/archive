I have a working code, but i don't know if it is minimal (I mean I copied and pasted it in the live lean web editor and it works)<br>\n2 - Also should I include the corollaries listed on the <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemme_des_noyaux\">wikipedia</a> page linked by the Missing undergraduate mathematics in mathlib webpage ? The question is, in order to consider this done all the way should I also do theorems proving : \"De plus, la projection de la somme directe V  sur V_i parallèlement à ⨁V_j est la restriction à V d'un polynôme en f.\" (the wikipedia only has a french version for this).</p>\n<p>Thanks !</p>",
