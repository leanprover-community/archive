Sure the natural number game is fun, but proving that the integers are a commutative ordered ring is very tedious, proving that the rationals are an ordered field is very tedious, and if you try to learn maths this way you'll never even get to the real numbers. At university I was told on day 1 that the real numbers existed and satisfied the completeness property, and was told not to worry about it. This saves many hours of boring manipulations.</p>",
