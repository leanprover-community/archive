Like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">change</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">with</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c\">/-</span><span class=\"cm\"> provide the proof for `x = y` -/</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"c\">/-</span><span class=\"cm\"> proceed the proof with `C[y]` -/</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It would be nice if I can also apply this tactic to hypothesis (e.g., using syntax <code>change x with y in H</code>) and also specify the position of <code>x</code> if there are multiple occurrences of <code>x</code>(e.g., using syntax <code>change x at 1 with y</code>).</p>\n<p>How could I do this in Lean4?</p>",
