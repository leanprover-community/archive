I also completed a formalization of Whitehead theorem (<a href=\"https://github.com/jzxia/WhiteheadTheorem/blob/6dca13508c0eccaddbf80ffcb874326d0ee11c1c/WhiteheadTheorem/Basic.lean\">link here</a>), but I worked directly with topological spaces most of the time; your model category approach is indeed cleaner and more extensible. (I wrote up my formalization into a Master's thesis in computer science at Zhejiang University, and I did mention your approach in the introduction chapter.)</p>\n<p>Do you plan to transfer your work into mathlib? Maybe I can help with that, and then specialize to the action for topological spaces.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yes, I plan to upstream almost 100% of my formalization of the model category structures on topological spaces (and simplicial sets). The model structure on <code>TopCat</code> uses a lot of results about Kan complexes. In your formalization, it seems you use arguments based on the homotopy extension property in order to define the transport of elements in homotopy groups along a path. This homotopy extension property is very much related to the lifting properties of Kan fibrations with respect to anodyne extensions between simplicial sets that I am using in my formalization, and the topological case should be a particular case of these results in the case of Kan complexes (if <code>X</code> is a topological space, we may apply these to the Kan complex <code>Sing X</code>).<br>\nIf you had used explicit (painful!) formulas in order to define the action, it would have definitely been very interesting to have this approach as well, but as both our formalizations rely on the same basic principles, it is probably easier to use on the \"anodyne extensions\" approach.<br>\nThe only thing that I am not completely sure about is how to relate the simplicial homotopy groups of a Kan complex (or a topological space) to the \"cubical\" homotopy groups (which is the definition that we have in mathlib for topological spaces): there are various ways to compare them, and I am not sure yet what is the best strategy.</p>",
