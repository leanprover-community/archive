I see the docs works. <a href=\"https://anandijain.github.io/ProofsWMathlib.lean/docs/ProofsWMathlib/Lean/day_2025_12_30.html\">https://anandijain.github.io/ProofsWMathlib.lean/docs/ProofsWMathlib/Lean/day_2025_12_30.html</a>.</p>\n<p>What I'm wondering is if there is a way that the compiler could cache the intermediate goal states so that I could interact with the proof in the documentatipn, without needing a full VSCode. This would be handy for reading formal proofs from others without needing to clone the repo. I believe it should be possible because it's not requiring the compiler itself, just a record of the changes to the state. I don't know anything about the internals, however.</p>\n<p>Is this possible? Thanks!</p>",
