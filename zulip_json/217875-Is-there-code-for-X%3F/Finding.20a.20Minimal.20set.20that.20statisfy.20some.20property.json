Let m:ℕ be some number and let have some property P of subsets of {1,...,m} (P:Set (Fin m) → Prop) . I know that the full set satisfy P and want to find a minimal set that satisfy this property, is there a simple way to do this?<br>\nFor context, I try to formulate the basics of min-entropy and density (from \"Rectangles are nonnegative juntas\") and specifically I need this for defining density restoration (Proposition 3.6. in \"QUERY-TO-COMMUNICATION LIFTING USING<br>\nLOW-DISCREPANCY GADGETS\").</p>",
