        "content": "<p>Yes, the norm is the operator norm. Beware that the norm on <code>Fin n → ℝ</code> is the L^\\infty norm, not the L^2 norm, which means that your second question is very highly non-canonical (and as far as I can tell we don't have that in mathlib) and I'm not even sure that your third question is true (while it would be true, up to a square root, for the L^2 norm). In general, the simplest way to calculate an operator norm is to come back to the definition, i.e., use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=NormedAddGroupHom.opNorm_le_bound#doc\">docs#NormedAddGroupHom.opNorm_le_bound</a>.</p>",
