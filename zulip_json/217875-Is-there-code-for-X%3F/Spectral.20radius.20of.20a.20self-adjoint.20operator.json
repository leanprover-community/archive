        "content": "<p>Well, you can't get a <em>maximum</em> Rayleigh quotient because in general the supremum will not be attained. In order for it to be attained, it must be the case that <code>‖T‖</code> is an eigenvalue, but <code>T</code> may have no eigenvalues at all if it is not compact.</p>\n<p>However, you can still show that the supremum of (absolute values of) the Rayleigh quotients is the operator norm. This uses the polarization identity and the parallelogram identity to bound <code>‖⟪x, T y⟫‖</code> by the supremum of the Rayleigh quotients (for unit vectors <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), which then implies that <code>‖T‖</code> is bounded by this quantity too. The other inequality is trivial.</p>\n<p>To tie this back to the spectral radius, you then show not that <code>‖T‖</code> is an eigenvalue, but that it (or <code>-‖T‖</code>) is an approximate eigenvalue, and hence in the spectrum. In other words, suppose that <code>‖T‖ = ⨆ x, ⟪x, T x⟫</code> (we can do this WLOG because the other option is that <code>-‖T‖</code> is the infimum). Then <code>(‖T‖ • 1 - T)</code> is not bounded below, hence not invertible and so <code>‖T‖</code> is in the spectrum (or, respectively, <code>-‖T‖</code> is)</p>\n<p>There's all kinds of formalization annoyances here related to the fact that you would be doing this for <code>RCLike 𝕜</code> instead of <code>ℝ</code> directly.</p>",
