The compactness results in my PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/30089\">#30089</a> (currently being reviewed by Chris B) are one step towards this. </p>\n<p>My next step was going to be to show that if <code>f</code> is a modular form of level Γ (and any weight), then the order of vanishing of f at z depends only on the Γ-orbit of z. This is fiddly; I have the code ready but it needs a little cleanup. Using that &amp; norm maps &amp; compactness of truncated fundamental domain one deduces that  there are only finitely many Γ-orbits where the order of vanishing is positive.</p>\n<p>With this in hand, one can argue that if <code>g \\in M_k(Γ)</code> vanishes to high enough order at some finite set of points, then it must be a multiple of <code>f</code> by something in <code>M_0(Γ)</code> (which we know is 1-dimensional). This exhibits a linear map from M_k(Γ) to a finite-dimensional space whose kernel is finite-dimensional, hence  M_k(Γ) is also finite-dimensional.   </p>\n<p>Happy to coordinate on this with anyone who's interested.</p>",
