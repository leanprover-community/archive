This is the one that starts with the analytic claims that, in the reals, any positive number has a square root, and any odd-degree polynomial has a root, and proceeds purely algebraically, using Galois theory and Sylow's theorems, to show that the only nontrivial algebraic extension of the reals is quadratic and moreover given by adjoining a square root of -1.</p>\n<p>For context, I'm trying to formalise some real algebra, specifically the theory of real closed fields, so it would be good to just generalise this proof. I don't <em>think</em> this proof is in Mathlib, but maybe it's in someone else's open source repo?</p>",
