Basically, it's a matter of Massot and Miller finding enough unobstructed time, i.e. blocked on finding some funding to buy out such time. If you sit on a bag of money for one person-year, this could be a useful contribution!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Was the goal changed to Lean Blueprint?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm quite puzzled by this question. Formal-to-informal translation and the blueprint software are two very different things.
