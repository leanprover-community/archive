I see that Banach-Alaoglu theorem (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall#doc\">docs#WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall</a>) is in Mathlib. It states that the closed balls of the continuous dual space of normed space <code>X</code> are compact for the weak-star topology. Do we have the sequential version of this? That is, if the space <code>X</code> is separable, then the closed balls are sequentially compact (in fact the weak-star topology on the closed balls in metrizable in this case).</p>",
