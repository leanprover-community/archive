The issue though arises right at the beginning with how to start. At it's core it's an inductive type that has one constructor that takes a pair of Sets of this type. But next to all of my ideas face the issue of \"[the constructor] has a non positive occurrence of the datatypes being declared\".  And I was unable to split this type into a family of types parameterized by the naturals. And advice, hints or ideas are appreciated.</p>",
