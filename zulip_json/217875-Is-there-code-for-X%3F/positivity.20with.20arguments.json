It is very inconvenient to be forced to do <code>have := foo; have := bar</code>, just in order to do <code>positivity</code>, instead of <code>positivity [foo, bar]</code>. Also, I found out that <code>positivity</code> can't use hypotheses of the form <code>∀ x : α, 0 ≤ x</code>. I assume the reasons for this are all performance-related.</p>",
