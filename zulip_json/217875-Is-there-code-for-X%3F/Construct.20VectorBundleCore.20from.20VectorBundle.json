Currently, I am trying to show that if I have a vector bundle, then it's fibres are <code>AddCommGroup</code> (and more generally, an <code>IsTopologicalAddGroup</code>). There is already <code>VectorBundleCore.addCommGroupFiber</code> which is almost what I want, but requires my type to be a <code>VectorBundleCore</code>. Any ideas on how to solve this?</p>",

For your question, by the very definition of a vector bundle the fibers are already <code>AddCommGroup</code> and <code>IsTopologicalAddGroup</code>. Do you have a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html\">#mwe</a> so I can understand your question better?</p>",
