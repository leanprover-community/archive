Is there something akin to what I need in mathlib, that doesn't require that <code>G</code> is a topology?</p>\n<p>For reference, my current WIP proof resides at <a href=\"https://github.com/adri326/rubin-lean4/\">https://github.com/adri326/rubin-lean4/</a><br>\nI'm also planning on contributing that proof to mathlib, once I finished proving it in Lean and cleaned it up enough for it to be ready for becoming part of a PR.</p>",
