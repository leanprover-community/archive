(You can send it to us publicly, privately, or via issue/PR.)<br>\nOne of the reasons why we didn't formalize Buchberger's algorithm is that <code>MvPolynomial</code> in Mathlib4 is noncomputable (because <code>Finsupp</code> is noncomputable), and even if made computable, is inefficient. We still welcome a verified based on it though.<br>\nBy the way, we also made a computable implementation of polynomial <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"113486\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/113486-announce/topic/Computable.20polynomial.20representation.20based.20on.20sorted.20list/with/540387250\">#announce &gt; Computable polynomial representation based on sorted list</a>.<br>\nThank you!
