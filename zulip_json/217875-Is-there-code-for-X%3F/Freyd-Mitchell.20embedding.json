As explained on the next slide, we're working on this on evenings and weekends and have many other commitments, and at our current pace we're still years away from finishing.</p>\n<p>That said, if you're looking for a way to work with abelian categories in your application, mathlib has some tools that are meant to make this easier in the absence of the full embedding theorem, see <a href=\"https://tqft.net/mathlib4files/CategoryTheory/Abelian/Refinements\">file#CategoryTheory/Abelian/Refinements</a> and <a href=\"https://tqft.net/mathlib4files/CategoryTheory/Abelian/Pseudoelements\">file#CategoryTheory/Abelian/Pseudoelements</a>.</p>",

I read your slide \"How to prove the embedding theorem (3)\", and you mentioned that the step of proving Grothendieck categories are complete was done. However, in <code>mathlib4</code> and all branches, I only found <code>Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Abelian.Generator</code>, which is related to step (4). This shows that we only need to prove Grothendieck categories have enough injectives to prove they have an injective cogenerator.</p>",
