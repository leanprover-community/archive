My first thought was the Riemann Mapping Theorem, but as it turns out, that's already done, pending a PR into mathlib.</p>\n<p>After a code search on GitHub, I've found that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_theorem\">Runge's Theorem</a> has not been formalized in Lean. Is there any similar project currently underway, or would this be a worthwhile new direction to explore?</p>",
