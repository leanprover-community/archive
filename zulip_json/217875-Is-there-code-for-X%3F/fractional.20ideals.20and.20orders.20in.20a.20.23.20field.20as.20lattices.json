We have a PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/19902\">#19902</a> for lattices, but so far it mainly concerns them over PID. Do we have plan to state the properties of lattices over a Dedekind domain (maybe more general), and state some theory of fractional ideals and orders using lattices?</p>",
