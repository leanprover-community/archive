So far the best I found is <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorAlgebra/Grading.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorAlgebra/Grading.html</a>, which defines the exterior algebra as a graded algebra.</p>\n<p>I asked lean to synthesize a <code>FiniteDimensional</code> instance on the nth exterior of a finite-dimensional vector space and got an error. That is not very hard to fix, but does this mean that mathlib doesn't have the formula for the dimension of the nth exterior power of a finite-dimensional vector space (or a free module of finite rank) ? </p>\n<p>Still about exterior powers but unrelated, what about the <code>NormedSpace</code> case ? Is the topological vector space structure on exterior powers defined ?</p>\n<p>The reason of all these questions, of course, is that I am trying to define the Pl√ºcker embedding from a Grassmannian to a projective space, and I want to do it coordinate-free. Hence exterior powers.</p>",

But now I have another question, as I don't just need a tvs structure to define the manifold structure, I need a <code>NormedSpace</code> instance: is there some preferred way to put a <code>NormedSpace</code> instance on a finite-dimensional vector space over a <code>NontriviallyNormedField</code> ? I have been looking at the <code>NormedSpace</code> files in mathlib but I haven't found anything yet. (Of course I can do it myself: use choice to pick an isomorphism with a <code>Fin r ‚Üí  ùïú</code> (where <code> ùïú</code> is my base field) and then transport the norm. I was just wondering is there's a better way.)</p>",

Instead I'd rather put the correct norm on exterior products of a normed space-- whatever that is. For the exterior product of a dual space, I know what this should be: the operator norm on multilinear maps. For the exterior product of a space, maybe embed it into its bidual and use the previous sentence -- or do that in a more canonical way I am not thinking of for now, probably.</p>",
