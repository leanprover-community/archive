Has anybody tried integrating this with GitHub somehow? </p>\n<p>For example, a GitHub action that, whenever a new <code>proof_wanted</code> theorem gets added to the repo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creates an issue tagged 'Proof wanted' with description taken from the docstring of the theorem, unless an issue is already referenced from the docstring.</li>\n<li>If an issue is created, adds a link to the issue to the docstring of the theorem (commit &amp; push).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(This could lead to adding some metadata to <code>proof_wanted</code>, but it's not strictly necessary.)</p>\n<p>This would allow maintainers to collect &amp; organise issues in github projects. Also, it'd allow people to declare that they're working on a (wanted) proof in the related issue on GitHub, fostering collaboration instead of duplicate work.</p>\n<p>This is just a sketch for the sake of discussion, I haven't really thought it through yet.</p>",
