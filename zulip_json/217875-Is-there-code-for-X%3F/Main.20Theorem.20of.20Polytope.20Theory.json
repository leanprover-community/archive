Then:<br>\n• 𝑋 is a 𝑉-polytope if it is the convex hull of a finite point set.<br>\n• 𝑋 is an 𝐻-polytope if it is the intersection of finitely many half spaces.</p>\n<p>Theorem : Every 𝑉-polytope is an 𝐻-polytope, and every compact 𝐻-polytope is a 𝑉-polytope.</p>\n<p>Is this theorem already part of the Mathlib?
