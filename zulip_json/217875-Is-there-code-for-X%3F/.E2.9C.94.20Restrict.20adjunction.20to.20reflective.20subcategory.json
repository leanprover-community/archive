Something like <code>R ⋙ F ⫞ G ⋙ L</code> where <code>L : C ⥤ E</code> and <code>R : E ⥤ C</code> are the reflector and inclusion of <code>E</code> in <code>C</code>. This seems general enough that I would hope that it's in mathlib already, but I haven't been able to find it so far and don't even really know what terms to search for</p>",
