Even just the up-to-iso bijection on objects would be interesting to see, of course the full dual equivalence including morphisms would be even better. <br>\nSearching Zulip, I found some old threads, <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Compact.20opens/near/270711249\">in particular this one</a>, but looking at the mathlib docs there are mostly definitions, not yet the accompanying theorems.</p>",
