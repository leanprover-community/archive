But I can't find it anymore.</p>\n<p>Again, do we have formal group laws in mathlib yet? Quoting from the book <em>Formal groups and applications</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An <code>n</code>-dimensional formal group law over a ring <code>A</code> is an <code>n</code>-tuple of of power series <code>F(X,Y)=(F_1(X,Y), ... ,F_n(X,Y))</code> in <code>2n</code> indeterminates <code>X_1, ... ,X_n, Y_1, ... ,Y_n</code> such that <code>F_i(X,Y) = X_i + Y_i mod deg 2</code>and <code>F_i(F(X,Y),Z)=F_i(X,F(Y,Z))</code> for all <code>i</code>. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the answer is no, as <code>F_i(F(X,Y),Z)</code> is not defined in mathlib yet. This is similar to <code>Polynomial.comp</code> or <code>[Mv]Polynomial.aeval</code>, but it needs to consider the topology. For now maybe <code>MvPowerSeries.comp</code> can be defined in an ad-hoc way, ignoring constant coefficients. Then we can, at least, write down the definition of formal group law.</p>\n<p>Some important properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a unique inverse power series <code>i(X)</code>. Should we add it to the definition, or just <code>noncomputable def</code> from a formal group law?</li>\n<li>Formal group law can give rise to actual groups.</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elliptic curves</li>\n<li>Fontaine's theory on p-divisible groups</li>\n</ul>",
