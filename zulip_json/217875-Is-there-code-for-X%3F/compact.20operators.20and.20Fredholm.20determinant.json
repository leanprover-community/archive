It's hard to imagine much of a \"base\" theory which is useful in both the classical and nonarchimedean world.</p>\n<p>Coleman developed the theory for Banach modules over an affinoid algebra and I generalised it further in my eigenvarieties paper (and fixed up a couple of issues with Coleman's exposition); one should perhaps revisit those sources and try and figure out the correct generality for all of this is in the nonarchimedean world.</p>",

I think the conclusion is that even if there are people working on the classical theory, the nonarchimedean people should develop their own nonarchimedean theory. As I know you know well, this is what we have done for adeles (developing the theory of finite and infinite adeles separately rather than taking a restricted product over all completions at once; we immediately separate off the archimedean and nonarchimedean completions despite it being technically possible to begin the story describing them both as completions of a number field at a place; it is there that the similarities in the arch and nonarch world end).</p>",
