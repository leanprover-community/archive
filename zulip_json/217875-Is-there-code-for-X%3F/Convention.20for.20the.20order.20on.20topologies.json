In mathlib <code>≥</code> represents <code>ge</code> which means `greater than or equal to\", and I see no difference between \"greater\" and \"larger\", so Conway's use of the word \"larger\" is consistent with the subset order but not the current default, the superset order. I wouldn't exclude the possibility that some authors use ≤ (or another notation of the same directionality) to mean ⊇ in the context of topologies, so you're welcome to provide another data point!</p>",

I've never seen <code>≤</code> used in this context so there is no trouble at all, and our convention simply works better for the way we do topology in mathlib, which is very suitable for formalization and does not exist on paper as far as we know.  Maybe we could redefine <code>topological_space X</code> to be a function from <code>X</code> to <code>filter X</code> satisfying the appropriate axiom so that you find the ordering more natural but I don't have time for this. The ordering we use are already fully consistent from filter to uniform spaces through topologies. I really don't see the point of inverting one order relation in the middle of this chain.</p>",
