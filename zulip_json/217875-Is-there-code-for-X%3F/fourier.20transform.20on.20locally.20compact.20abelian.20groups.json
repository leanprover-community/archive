In the case of a profinite group this is standard: one considers the supremum over sums of characteristic functions on cosets of finite index subgroups. Characteristic functions on these cosets have an integral (again in the finite case) which is a simple summation over <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">1/d</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1/</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">d</span></span></span></span> for <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">d</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">d</span></span></span></span> the index of the (open) finite index subgroup.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06852\">Here</a> is an outline of a monograph in which it is shown (or at least stated) that pro-Lie groups contain all locally compact abelian groups.</p>\n<p>I think I should say could seem to push in a different direction than where the group here is going, but I don't intend it that way.</p>\n<p>Together with various combinations of advanced results showing that Pro-Lie is an extensive class (generalized further by the work of Tate on Tate modules, in which for example Laurent series obtain a Haar integral as well), these constructions have the interesting consequence of using <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">R</span></span></span></span>-linearity.</p>",
