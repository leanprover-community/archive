If Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup were also a submonoid (it's not defined that way), then we could just take their inf, but Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup is a hand-rolled type.</p>\n<p>So, the question is: do we hand-roll Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup or make it the submonoid which is the inf of Matrix.unitaryGroup and the range of Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup under the coercion homomorphism?</p>\n<p>Of course, the same applies to Matrix.specialOrthogonalGroup.</p>",
