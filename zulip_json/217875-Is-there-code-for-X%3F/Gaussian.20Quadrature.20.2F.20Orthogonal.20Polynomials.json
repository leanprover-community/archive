I was thinking that a few theorems on orthogonal polynomials and gaussian quadrature could be feasible, and I didn't find them in mathlib, although I'm new to Lean so maybe I just missed them. Do you know if they are really missing from mathlib? Or if there's someone already working on them? Thanks for the help, and sorry if this isn't the right stream to ask this!</p>",
