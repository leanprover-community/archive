However in her case the normed ring she was working with was complete, so she made it a normed Q_p-algebra and the problem went away. I only got as far as observing that her imports implied that Q had a norm and it was the archimedean norm. For the reals this is reasonable but the rationals has infinitely many interesting norms on it and choosing one of them once and for all seems to me like not a good idea unless there really is a good counterargument.</p>",
