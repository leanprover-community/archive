Example: Let's say I need to verify something about the code and my OCaml implementation generates some verification conditions that are sent to Lean, where the tactics and formalized theory are present to discharge proof obligations, and Lean resolves the proof and returns either further goal states (for interactivity with my OCaml implementation) or success if proved. There exists an interface with Coq based on <a href=\"https://www.why3.org/doc/itp.html#coq\">Why3</a>, but I can't find something similar for LEAN4.</p>\n<p>Also, has anyone tried to do something like this? If yes, would be grateful for some insight on how easy or hard it was and whether LEAN is suitable for such purposes or not.</p>",
