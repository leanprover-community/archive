I think I ran into proofs where this would allow me to solve a goal with just simplification, no need for <code>split</code>.</p>\n<p>Of course it can only float it out as far as the condition (or the scrutinee of a matcher) ’s local variables allow.</p>\n<p>(There is some similarity to Isabelle’s _splitter_ feature in the Simplifier, only that it's simpler and nicer in our case because we can put propositions into the branches.)</p>",
