There doesn't appear to be a definition in mathlib for reasoning about abstract simplicial complexes directly, so if I wanted to do this, should I just write my own definition and go from there? eg:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">structure</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AbstractSimplicialComplex</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">DecidableEq</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">where</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">faces</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Set</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Finset</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">empty_mem</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">∅</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Finset</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∈</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">faces</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">downward_closed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∀</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">F</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">G</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Finset</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">},</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">F</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∈</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">faces</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">G</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">⊆</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">F</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">G</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">∈</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">faces</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I see there's a definition for <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Convex/SimplicialComplex/Basic.html#Geometry.SimplicialComplex\">geometric simplicial complexes</a> but I'm not sure it's sufficient for what I want to do. I also saw that someone relatively recently <a href=\"#narrow/channel/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Abstract.20simplicial.20complex.20and.20the.20homology.20of.20S_n\">asked about the geometric realization</a> in another context. Having a function that lets me pass between a hypothetical <code>AbstractSimplicialComplex</code> structure and <code>Geometry.SimplicialComplex</code> would be helpful in proving certain results. For example, if I want to prove or work with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_approximation_theorem\">simplicial approximation theorem</a>. </p>\n<p>Is anyone aware of any existing ongoing effort to work with abstract simplicial complexes directly? If not, would it be reasonable to roll my own definition (as above) and start from there? Thoughts?</p>\n<p>also, this is my first post, does it go in new members instead?</p>",
