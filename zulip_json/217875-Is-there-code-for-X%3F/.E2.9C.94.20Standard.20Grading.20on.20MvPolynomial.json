I'd like to formalize some results about homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings with the standard grading.  I see that Mathlib has <code>Ideal.IsHomogeneous</code> for graded rings, and <code>IsHomogeneous</code> for homogeneous polynomials in MvPolynomial, but I can't find a graded ring structure on MvPolynomial.</p>",
