We have five talks lined up so far, and there's space for a couple more. </p>\n<p>I'm excited to flag one item in particular, which is the <a href=\"https://leaning.in/#clinic\">Proof Clinic</a>. The intention of the proof clinic is for participants to show us where they're stuck with Lean, or having trouble, and work with the group to try to get unstuck. No promises, but we'll try! Topics can be as complicated as \"How do I choose between competing definitions?\" to \"How do I install Lean?\" See <a href=\"https://leaning.in/#program\">the program</a> for more details.</p>",
