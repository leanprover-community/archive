For my project this was in <code>docbuild/docs/references.bib</code> because the CI making the docs runs in the <code>docbuild</code> subfolder and <code>docs/references.bib</code> is <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/blob/a71fdaa4800d0e0ea990f74aafea3e6c13eec2fb/lakefile.lean#L177\">hard-coded here</a> in doc-gen4.<br>\nMaybe you have the same setup in the combinatorial-games project, as you also have a <code>docbuild</code> folder? Anyway, in case it helps you <a href=\"https://github.com/m4lvin/lean4-pdl/commit/830e3dac369380eedd9ad1578be516c240c922e0\">here</a> is the commit adding the <code>.bib</code> file in my project and <a href=\"https://m4lvin.github.io/lean4-pdl/docs/references.html\">this</a> is the result.</p>",
