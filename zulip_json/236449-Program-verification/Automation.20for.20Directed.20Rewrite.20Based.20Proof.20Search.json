The rewrites are directed because the semantics are nondeterministic and some rewrites are refinements which reduce non-determinism irreversibly.</p>\n<p>Using sequences of rewrites, I can prove complex program equivalences, but the proofs become long and unwieldy quickly.  I have monotonicity lemmas for each operation, so to apply a rewrite deep in an AST, I apply a sequence of monotonicity lemmas to get the spot I want to rewrite at the root and then apply the rule. This makes proofs long, and the process feels readily automatable.</p>\n<p>Are there automation tools for Lean which would be appropriate for this task?</p>",
