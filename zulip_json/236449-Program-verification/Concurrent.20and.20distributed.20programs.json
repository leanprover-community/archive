But, if you're verifying software on a limited schedule/budget, working in a model checker like TLA+ is probably more efficient than formalizing your entire system in Lean and then proving properties.</p>\n<p>I found a HN comment that basically says this ^^^ from a Ph.D. in formal methods <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31953198\">here</a>, and the Lean website has <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/talks/stanford2017.pdf\">this</a> related slide deck. Hope that helps somewhat...</p>",

There's been a lot of work on modelling concurrent programs using program logics (<a href=\"https://iris-project.org/\">https://iris-project.org/</a>). There's been an initiative in replicating this in lean, but most of the code is in Coq/roqc ATM.<br>\nThere's also quite a bit of work on modelling distributed systems (again in Coq/roqc). E.g. verification of raft or Nakamoto consensus. Similar ideas can be applied in lean.</p>",
