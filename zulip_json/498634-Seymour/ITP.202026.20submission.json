Formalization of matroid theory faces many challenges, most importantly that only a limited number of notions and results have been implemented so far. In this work, we formalize the proof of the forward (composition) direction of Seymour's theorem for regular matroids. To this end, we develop a library in Lean 4 that implements definitions and results about totally unimodular matrices, vector matroids, their standard representations, regular matroids, and 1-, 2-, and 3-sums of matrices and binary matroids given by their standard representations. Using this framework, we formally state Seymour’s decomposition theorem and implement a formally verified proof of the composition direction in the setting where the matroids have finite rank and may have infinite ground sets.</p>",

There are actually things to be done to shorten the paper without sacrificing any content. Note that the code snippets have many linebreak that were not present in the repository.

Thank you <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"985790\">@Cameron Rampell</span> for handling it!</p>\n<p>I am disappointed by how many of you ignored the revisions of our paper. As a result, I had to point out numerous issues myself, which made me exert much more influence on this submission than I intended. I hoped that everybody would express their views on what the paper should contain, and I am sorry that the result doesn't reflect the opinions of all of us. As a consequence, the paper is again mostly \"the thing that Martin and Ivan wrote\" even though I wanted to step back and let others take the wheel.</p>\n<p>While I am pretty good at writing code, I am absolutely miserable at writing text. Had others written the text collaboratively and I provided only the polished version of the code, the result could have been much better than what we submitted.</p>",
