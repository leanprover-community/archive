I am not entirely sure it is viable.</p>\n<p>A third option, arguably much harder, would be to generalize <code>VectorMatroid.exists_standardRepr_isBase_isTotallyUnimodular</code> to not require finiteness and then do the first suggested refactor. That said, I still wouldn't know how to resolve the other problems required for <code>Matroid.IsCographic.isRegular</code> being proved.</p>\n<p>As for me, I would like to focus on the 3-sum now.</p>",
