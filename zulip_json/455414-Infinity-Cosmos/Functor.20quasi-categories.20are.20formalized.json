The idea is that if a subcomplex <code>A</code> of <code>X</code> is such that <code>X</code> is obtained from <code>A</code> by attaching simplices along horns, then the nondegenerate simplices of <code>X</code> not in <code>A</code> come by pairs (a simplex, along with the face which does not belong to the corresponding horn). In order to show that the inclusion <code>A ⟶ X</code> is a strong anodyne extension, it suffices to produce such a \"pairing\", and show that a certain ancestrality relation is well founded (in order to be able to add a simplex, we need to know that all faces but one are already in our subcomplex).</p>",

I have completely done the case <code>k &lt; m</code> (but the case <code>k = m</code> could probably be deduced by using a certain symmetry). When we have <code>0 &lt; k &lt; m</code>, I have verified that only inner horns are used, which will allow a more conceptual proof of the verification that in the case <code>m = 2</code>, <code>k = 1</code>, we have a strong inner anodyne extension.</p>",
