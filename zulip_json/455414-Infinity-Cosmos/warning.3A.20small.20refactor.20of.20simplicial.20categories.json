The typeclass <code>EnrichedOrdinaryCategory V C</code> provides a bijection between types of morphisms in <code>C</code> in types of morphisms <code>𝟙_ V ⟶ (X ⟶[V] Y)</code> in <code>V</code>. The phrasing I had chosen for simplicial categories works immediately in this more general situation, so that if some code breaks, the fix should be easy.</p>",
