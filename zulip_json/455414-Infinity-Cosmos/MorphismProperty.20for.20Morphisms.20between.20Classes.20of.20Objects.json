The only concern I have is that this might not play well with typeclass synthesis.</p>\n<p>But I think this is only useful if you have a bunch of morphism properties of this shape and you need to argue metaproperties of them and juggle with the negation or conjunction of them etc. Judging from the PR message alone (without knowing the big picture so I might be way off), it seems that it's just a single morphism property that does not behave the right way when the codomain is lacking conditions. I would suggest to just give it a \"junk value\" (following the rest of mathlib) on these non-sensical inputs and add relevant additional hypotheses when needed.</p>",
