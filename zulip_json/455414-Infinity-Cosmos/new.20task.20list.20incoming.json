Sometime in the next few days, I should be ready to post a new task list to map out the second phase of the infinity-cosmos project. </p>\n<p>The main objectives will be to :</p>\n<p>(i) develop a bit of infinity-cosmos theory (the easier results from section 1.5)<br>\n(ii) develop a bit more enriched category theory (about enriched completeness and enriched change of base)<br>\n(iii) prove that the homotopy category functor preserves products (when restricted to quasi-categories), a task from the original list now spread over a series of lemmas appearing in the new section 1.3<br>\n(iv) compare Cat-enriched categories and 2-categories.<br>\n(v) An optional side quest: to prove that 1-categories define an infinity-cosmos (see section 1.7).</p>\n<p>The upshot will be the construction of the 2-category of infinity-categories contained in an infinity-cosmos. Then the formal category theory can begin.</p>\n<p>Here is a question: where should I put the new tasks? Appended to an edited version of the original list? Later in the same thread? In a new thread? I have no idea where it is least likely to get lost.</p>",
