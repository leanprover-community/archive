Pinging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"246635\">@Emily Riehl</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"406521\">@Arnoud van der Leer</span>, who may have an interest in seeing the code.</p>\n<p>There is one issue that seems beyond my understanding. The current version of this code introduces an <code>abbrev</code> definition <code>Ehom V C x y</code> for the hom-object C(x, y) in V. The intention is to make the code easier to read; the existing notation <code>x \\hom[V] y</code> throws an error when instantiated at <code>C</code> = <code>V</code> (<code>ambiguous term;</code> <code>Possible interpretations:</code> <code>(ihom x).obj y : V</code> <code>x ⟶[V] y : V</code>). Moreover, there are a few calls to <code>erw</code> that stem from a failure to identify <code>(ihom x).obj : V</code> with <code>Ehom V V x y</code>. It seems there's some underlying issue that I'm not sure how to address?</p>",
