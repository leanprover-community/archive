The idea of it would be to specialize to a particular interval (the coherent iso) and to the case where <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are quasi-categories. </p>\n<p>Whether it is a good idea to factor that specific notion of equivalence through this general framework is unclear to me, so feel free to ignore and start from scratch.</p>\n<p>No one is working on lemma 1.2.36 I believe so that's all yours! Good luck and let us know if there's anything you want to discuss.</p>",
