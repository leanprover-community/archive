I could also just as easily imagine having an infinity category would allow you to construct a model of Lean’s type theory.)</p>",

I have seen people draw it as a 2D plane. In HoTT, each universe can have an independent \"amount\" of univalence, e.g. Type 0 is a 1-type, Type 1 is a 42-type, Type 2 is a 37-type and the others are infty-types for example. All of these variations have the same consistency strength, it is only the number and closure properties of universes that matters for consistency.</p>",
