Of course it is a completely different approach, and I think PhysLean should have both, but it may help to see how to derive the axioms/assumptions you will have to make in your ideal gas structure.</p>",

Morally, what Lieb-Yngvason did was proving a bunch of things that are needed for a thermodynamic entropy to exist. While obviously I'll be assuming a bunch of properties of the entropy, as per Callen's axioms. It'd be great to find the proper way to connect these two approaches, although I'm not entirely sure how.</p>",
