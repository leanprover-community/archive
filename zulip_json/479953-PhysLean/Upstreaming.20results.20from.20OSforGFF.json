Though it seems that <code>SpaceTime</code> in OSforGFF is Euclidean SpaceTime not Minkowski as it is in PhysLean, so they may be better fitted into: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lean-phys-community/PhysLean/tree/master/PhysLean/SpaceAndTime/TimeAndSpace\">https://github.com/lean-phys-community/PhysLean/tree/master/PhysLean/SpaceAndTime/TimeAndSpace</a> </p>\n<p>If anyone wants to volunteer to help with this upstreaming, that would be great.</p>",
