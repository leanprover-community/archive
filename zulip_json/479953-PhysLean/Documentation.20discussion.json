I agree that level of detail is useful when trying to learn PhysLean but is excessive for a more seasoned user trying to get a quick idea of what the theorem says, and would significantly expand the length of files making everything harder to find. I think simple doc-strings for individual theorems (like <code>eigenfunction_mul</code>) are fine - there are other, better ways to help new users. For example, rather than listing the statements of every theorem used in the proof we teach new users how to search the documentation website for a specific theorem name to learn what it says. I think this is an instance of it's better for learning to give new users the tools to find the answer to their questions themselves rather than providing all that information directly. My worry is that using and understanding PhysLean does require knowledge of Lean, and trying to sidestep that is going to create more problems down the road.</p>",

It's likely too early as we have not yet reached that critical mass and complexity but it is the type of things that help, at least psychologically to orientate oneself. Also it would be nice to have some 'trajectories' of how API should be connected in the long run: 'medium term' TODOs alongside the immediate ones.
