We do this by<br>\nintroducing an axiom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't have plans to do much with this yet, except maybe add something to </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/HEPLean/PhysLean_notes\">https://github.com/HEPLean/PhysLean_notes</a></p>\n<p>about it. But would be keen to hear any feedback. </p>\n<p>I'm hoping the definition I've given actually reflects the real-world use of seconds. That is it compares the time between two events relative to the time measured for some standard event.</p>",
