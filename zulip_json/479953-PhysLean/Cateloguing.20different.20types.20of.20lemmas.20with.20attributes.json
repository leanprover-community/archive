I'm thinking of examples like: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equivariance under a group action. </li>\n<li>Invariance under a group action. </li>\n<li>Monotonicity </li>\n<li>Property reflection under a map </li>\n<li>Property preservation under a map </li>\n<li>Algebraic rewriting </li>\n<li>Integral calculation </li>\n<li>Derivative calculation </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea would be to help people find lemmas of a given type, and maybe given them ideas on how to prove a result they are after.</p>",
