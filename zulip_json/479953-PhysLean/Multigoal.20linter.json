This is related to this (almost year old) GitHub issue <a href=\"https://github.com/HEPLean/PhysLean/pull/353\">PhysLean#353</a>. I think this will be a lot of work to fix all of the warnings it will give already, but maybe there is a way that we can turn it on only for new changes and then slowly go back and change it throughout the library. Or maybe this is somewhere AI can help.</p>",
