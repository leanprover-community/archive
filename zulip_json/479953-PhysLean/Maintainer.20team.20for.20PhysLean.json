I am very keen to do this, not because of any workload issues, but because I think it is best to maximize the community nature of the project. It is also a recipe that seems to work with Mathlib, and therefore something we could replicate. </p>\n<p>This has also being discussed here: </p>\n<p><a class=\"message-link\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/557175-Lean-Together-2026/topic/Leopoldo.20Sarra.20-.20autoformalization.20in.20physics.20.2F.20engineering/near/569176647\">#Lean Together 2026 &gt; Leopoldo Sarra - autoformalization in physics / engineering @ 💬</a> </p>\n<p>The two main responsibilities would be to: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Review PRs for physical correctness, readability, style etc. (including those of other members of the Maintainer team)</li>\n<li>Help structure and guide the project. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>(The default for PhysLean on policies etc. has been and I think always will be to just default to Mathlib's policy.)</p>\n<p>Because of these responsibilities I think the minimum requirements to be on the maintainer team are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Some experience of the Mathlib review process and what that involves. </li>\n<li>Some background in physics (or have a lot of experience with Mathlib to balance this). </li>\n<li>Ability to act impartially and independently from any other affiliations. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the moment I suspect the workload to be very small &lt;=1 hour a week. As I said above, this would have to be done completely voluntary, as is true for all open source projects, but it would hopefully give people a chance to have a bit of ownership over the project. </p>\n<p>If you are interested send me a DM. If you have comments on this in general (e.g. want to suggest other responsibilities or requirements) feel free to below.</p>",
