The complete formalization, with all proofs machine-checked, is available at  <a href=\"http://github.com/matthew-scherf/137\">github.com/matthew-scherf/137</a></p>\n<p>Starting from 8 substrate axioms (uniqueness, indivisibility, timelessness, inseparability, gauge invariance, relational individuation, observational manifestation) plus 4 axioms connecting ontology to physics, the formalization derives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three fermion generations (∃! n_gen : ℕ, n_gen = 3)</li>\n<li>Three color charges (∃! n_colors : ℕ, n_colors = 3)  </li>\n<li>Euler characteristic χ = -6</li>\n<li>First Chern class c₁ = 3</li>\n<li>Fine structure constant at GUT scale α⁻¹_GUT = 137</li>\n<li>Phenomenological correction δ = 0.036 (computed from δ = N² × D × σ)</li>\n<li>Observed value α⁻¹_obs = 137.036</li>\n<li>Algebraic verification of the RG correction formula</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The formalization uses a custom <code>EnergyScale</code> structure as a dependent pair bundling real values with certified positivity proofs. The renormalization group verification establishes that <code>(β_eff / 2π) × ln(E_GUT/m_e) = δ</code> through a series of auxiliary lemmas handling non-zero denominators and logarithm properties.</p>\n<p>Key proof techniques include using dependent pairs for physical constraints (energy scales must be positive),  existential elimination and introduction (obtain/use tactics), field arithmetic with certified non-zero conditions, numerical verification via norm_num and compositional theorem structure (each result builds on previous)</p>\n<p>Instead of encoding physics equations directly, the formalization starts from ontological principles and derives physical structure as necessary consequences. All existence claims are constructive. The phenomenological correction is computed from first principles rather than fitted to data. The formalisation bridges metaphysics, topology, and quantum field theory in a single coherent framework.</p>\n<p>I'm not an academic. No institutional affiliation, no physics PhD. I come from a contemplative background and have been working on formal verification of non-dual philosophical systems (Advaita Vedanta, Dzogchen, etc.) in Isabelle/HOL and Lean. This project emerged from exploring whether fundamental physical constants could be understood as emergent from ontological substrate properties.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and for creating such a powerful proof assistant and supportive community.<br>\nMatthew</p>\n<p>P.S. If this belongs in a different stream, please let me know and I'll move it. Wasn't sure if #new members, #mathlib, or #Lean 4 was most appropriate.</p>",
