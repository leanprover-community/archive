Associated with these two Higgs fields is a <a href=\"https://heplean.com/docs/HepLean/BeyondTheStandardModel/TwoHDM/Basic.html\">potential</a> whose minimum and boundness is very important to physics (it is what determines mass in the universe). The theorems in the above paper prove results related to these minima and boundness properties. </p>\n<p><em>Math context:</em> The actual maths involved is simple algebraic manipulation with potentially a small bit of calculus and group theory. </p>\n<p><em>Current progress:</em> Some of the set-up is already in HepLean but not much substantial progress has been made to proving these results.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> I don't believe you need to know much/any physics to do this project.</p>",
