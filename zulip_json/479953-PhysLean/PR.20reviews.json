By plugins, I meant various tools that are used by devs to verify the vulnerabilities and corner cases in llm generated code. Because more and more of it will go into building backend infrastructure of the physlean repo, it will be better to have some kind of feedback loop because llm generates verbose code with flavor of an independent coder and it's time-consuming for anyone to debug it later if issues escape notice</p>\n<p>Also, making llm generated code part of a public repo also means the user needs to check if it has not accidentally mentioned private details of the user's laptop or files anywhere in the code or hard-coded some private info available to it. For static things like dashboard, claude shouldn't make mistakes and the mistakes should at worst just cause dashboard to be incorrect but it's better to have such guardrails. I use llm for private repos and for me \"/review\" command from claude and bandit python package suffices but I'm also trying to learn more sophisticated methods being developed to give feedback on PRs, that's why asked out of curiosity.</p>",
