The other PR on hopfield networks has been awaiting a more principled (for PhysLean) and physically grounded approach based on spin glasses (following Talagrand's book), which is now finally in good shape for PR, though it would need me to PR a big chunk of completed prerequisites (GaussianIntegrationByParts) to Mathlib, which again I plan to do soon.</p>",
