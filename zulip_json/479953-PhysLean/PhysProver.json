The initial set of 134 theorems were manually extracted from [49]. An automated coding agent (Claude Opus [6]) first generated formal statements and proof attempts for the theorems, producing both complete proofs and partial derivations. A quantum physics expert then reviewed each statement and proof, identifying gaps, correcting errors, and standardizing operator definitions to ensure that each question was well formed and solvable. The final dataset replaces these proofs with sorry statements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The citation 49 is Michael A Nielsen and Isaac L Chuang. Quantum computation and quantum information.</p>",
