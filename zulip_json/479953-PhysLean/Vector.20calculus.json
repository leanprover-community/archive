There was a huge pushback from the analysts here; their argument was that the correct way to formalize integration was via some exotic integral taking values in a topological vector space, and that there was no point setting up the theory of 1-variable calculus, it should all be deduced from a multivariable theory; the argument was that multivariable calculus is not done by induction on number of variables, and there was simply no point doing the one-variable case when we knew we wanted the multivariable case. The idea was to deduce the FTC from some form of Stokes' theorem applied to an interval in the reals, with boundary the two endpoints. I argued and I argued (because I had a pile of 1st year undergraduates desperate to formalize analysis as they were being taught it) but I didn't get my way, and ultimately I think that the community made the right decision by ignoring me and doing things the way Bourbaki did them.</p>",

But in science and engineering, “undergrad math” is not just a reasonable level of math for most learners, but many/most of the people driving the field forward don’t have much more math than the typical core taught to scientists and engineers.

this can't be that bad.</p>\n<p>Now I'm realizing that <code>Space</code> and <code>Time</code> lives in different domains, and I'm actually trying to do differentiation in <code>ℝ × ℝ³</code>. I think how I'll have to approach this is to turn <code>Space</code> and <code>Time</code> derivatives into <code>SpaceTime</code> derivatives where the domain is <code>ℝ × ℝ³</code> via <code>timeSlice</code>, and in Lean terms this involves a whole lot of (un)currying. </p>\n<p>Many thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"653351\">@Joseph Tooby-Smith</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"346070\">@Tomas Skrivan</span> for their help and patience!</p>",

For <code>ℝ</code> there is only really one direction we would want to take a derivative, so we use <code>1</code> for this second <code>ℝ</code>. <br>\nThus <code>fderiv 𝕜 f x 1</code> is the derivative of <code>f</code> at the position <code>x</code> projected along <code>1</code> - the is the normal derivative of <code>x</code>. This mirrors the definition of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=deriv#doc\">docs#deriv</a>. </p>\n<p>Now turning to <code>HasFDerivAt</code>. The condition  <code>∀ x, HasFDerivAt f (f' x) x</code> says that <code>f</code> has a derivative equal to <code>f' x</code> at <code>x</code>. In otherwords, that <code>fderiv 𝕜 f x = f' x</code>, or <br>\nthat <code>fderiv 𝕜 f = f'</code>. <br>\nNote that <code>f' x</code> does not yet specify the direction of that derivative, it is a function  <code>ℝ →L[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)</code>. We only take the derivatives in the direction <code>1</code> so actually care about <code>f' x 1</code>. One could probably use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=HasDerivAt#doc\">docs#HasDerivAt</a> here instead, and not carry around this direction. </p>\n<p>Given this: <code>(h'' : ∀ x, HasFDerivAt (fun x =&gt; f' x 1) (f'' x) x)</code> says that the function <code>(fun x =&gt; f' x 1)</code> (that is the derivative of <code>f</code> in the direction <code>1</code>) has derivative at <code>x</code> equal to  <code>f'' x</code>, for all <code>x</code>. Again <code>f'' x</code> does not specify a direction so is a function <code>ℝ →L[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)</code> and thus we will really get <code>f'' x 1</code> appearing.</p>",
