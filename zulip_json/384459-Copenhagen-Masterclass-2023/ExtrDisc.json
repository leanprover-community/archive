I know that in the lecture notes so far, extr.discs have always been considered in the CH setting. But I can imagine that in the broader scope of mathlib, we might want to reserve <code>ExtrDisc</code> for the topological spaces that are merely extr.disc and not necessarily CH.</p>\n<p>There are other candidates: <code>Stonean</code> seems to be somewhat common in the literature. And another option would be <code>CHED</code>. In fact, recently I've been discussing about <code>LCHED</code> a bit with Reid (so that would be locally compact Hausdorff extr.discs).</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"519559\">@Dagur √Åsgeirsson</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243562\">@Adam Topaz</span></p>",
