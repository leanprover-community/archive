I showed certain properties (like long exact sequences of <code>Ext</code>) with this definition, but it is currently still unusable because we cannot compute anything yet.<br>\nHowever, I have finished a series of PR which identifies <code>Ext^0</code> to morphisms in <code>C</code>, and deduce by induction that the <code>Ext^n</code> types are <code>w</code>-small (i.e. <code>HasExt.{w}</code> holds) when <code>C</code> has enough projectives. (The dual result would be easy to obtain as well.) This is a major step towards allowing computations of <code>Ext</code>-groups, e.g. in categories of modules. (With just a little more work, we may get the canonical <code>t</code>-structure on the derived category.)<br>\nThese PRs are mostly about the study of the canonical truncations <code>truncGE</code> and <code>truncLE</code> of cochain complexes, which are developed in the general situation of embeddings of complex shapes (a notion which was introduced in the LTE, but then canonical truncations were not considered).</p>",
