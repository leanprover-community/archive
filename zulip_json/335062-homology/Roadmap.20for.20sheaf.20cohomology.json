This is Theorem 13 in the same paper of Kempf. Here we take the non-alternating Cech complex, but where you choose an ordering on the opens in the cover and you don't repeat indices, so it is finite. You can also use the cohomology of this complex as a \"cheap\" definition of Cech cohomology in that case, and use this to do calculations like the cohomology of line bundles on projective space. I also did that in an algebraic geometry class, though the calculations were exercises!</p>",
