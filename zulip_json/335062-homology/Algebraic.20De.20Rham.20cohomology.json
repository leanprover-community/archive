For example, from a presentation of an algebra, I obtain a presentation of the module of <code>1</code>-differentials <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/18440\">#18440</a>. Then, from a presentation of a module, I obtain a presentation of its exterior powers. Applying this to the obvious presentation of <code>B</code> as an <code>A</code>-algebra (one generator for each element of <code>B</code>, add three types of relations), we may obtain a presentation of <code>⋀[B]^n (Ω[B⁄A])</code> as a <code>B</code>-module. The tricky part is to deduce a presentation of the restriction of scalars of this module as an <code>A</code>-module, but using general principles <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/18389\">#18389</a>, we can get one for which the generators are <code>b₀ db₁ ∧ db₂ ∧ ... ∧ dbₙ</code>, and then the exterior derivative can be defined on these generators as <code>db₀ ∧ db₁ ∧ db₂ ∧ ... ∧ dbₙ</code>.</p>",

There are a few other sorries here and there, but they will dissolve when the various parts come together in mathlib.
