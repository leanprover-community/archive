I don't think there is any websockets involved, the Lean server simply sends widget information the same way it sends everything. But then all widgets are graphical. Displaying them is the issue. To be very specific, I'm not talking about toys such as the Hanoi towers widgets here, I'm talking about what you can see in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/.22unfold.22.20a.20proposition/near/240804412\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/.22unfold.22.20a.20proposition/near/240804412</a> for instance.

This makes it a bit easier to see what changes from one state to the next. Specifically, you can place down a \"diff pin\" that is diff'ed against the current state, and we also have an \"auto diff pin\" mode (which I'm using here) to make the diff pin automatically trail the cursor so that if you're precise enough about your motions it will immediately show you the diff from the previous tactic.</p>\n<p>This just uses vim's built-in text-based diff functionality, so it can get messy (as you saw near the end there). I expect we'd eventually have something more precise for Lean 4. And as always you can take this as a call for beta testers, let us know if you find any bugs!</p>",

The window size gets set by goneovim according to its settings.toml file, which is loaded after the regular nvim config files.  So to get goneovim to set the window size, I run <code>set columns=N</code> and <code>set lines=M</code> from goneovim's settings.toml.  Running <code>set columns=N</code> and <code>set lines=M</code> before that point is overridden when goneovim configures its window.  lean.nvim, I would guess, runs before that point, so it doesn't know that goneovim is going to change the window size.  </p>\n<p>The workaround is just to <em>also</em> set the columns and lines in my nvim startup file (.vim/vimrc in my case).  Then lean.nvim knows what the window size is supposed to be, and later goneovim will set the window to the same size in response to seeing the set columns/lines when settings.toml is read.</p>",

You should be able to update to it in whatever plugin manager you're using, e.g. via <code>:Lazy update</code>.</p>\n<p>There's one 'big' feature and some small tweaks.<br>\nThe bigger one is...</p>\n<h4>Infoview View Options</h4>\n<p>We now have configurable view options, a la VSCode.<br>\nThis means you can dynamically hide hypotheses which are instances, types, or inaccesible names in the infoview.<br>\nYou can also reverse the order of the goal state such that the goal is on top.</p>\n<p>Here's a quick GIF:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/2JXdD8gDSGfewGkAeyE5W1r4/Screen-Recording-2024-09-28-at-16.gif\">Screen Recording 2024-09-28 at 16.gif</a></p>\n<p>Some documentation for this configuration is <a href=\"https://github.com/Julian/lean.nvim/wiki/The-lean.nvim-Manual#customizing-the-infoview\">in the Manual</a>, but here's the tl;dr:</p>\n<p>A new <code>&lt;LocalLeader&gt;v</code> mapping is now enabled within Lean files. It opens a window where you can hit <code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code> on each line to toggle the setting you're on top of. Hit <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> when you're done to confirm your choices, or hit <code>K</code> if you want a hover showing you more information about the setting.</p>\n<p>Please provide any feedback!</p>\n<p>Also... I'd love to hear if anyone has ideas for further filtering beyond these options!<br>\nNow's a good time for me to implement any such ideas, and I know the VSCode functionality hasn't really changed since it was introduced, so perhaps if you deal with proofs with lots of hypotheses often, you have suggestions for other things we could configurably filter!<br>\nFeel free to post them!</p>\n<h4>Other Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you know that the <code>conv</code> tactic uses a different prefix (<code>|</code>) for showing goals in the infoview? I didn't. But now <code>lean.nvim</code> properly shows that prefix instead.</li>\n<li>Version numbers, clearly. Going forward, <code>lean.nvim</code> will have \"releases\". This really doesn't affect you as a user, it's at the minute simply an excuse to write up release notes when <code>lean.nvim</code> gets something new + notable.</li>\n<li><code>lean.nvim</code> is now <a href=\"https://luarocks.org/modules/Julian/lean.nvim\">on <code>Luarocks</code></a>. Unless you plan on interfacing with Lean via Lua, you probably don't care about this either.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<h3><code>lean.nvim</code> v2024.10.1 <img alt=\":neovim:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://avatars.zulip.com/3121/emoji/images/6feb8e9e.png\" title=\"neovim\"></h3>\n<p>Oh hello there. Another new release of <code>lean.nvim</code> is out! There are a few nice features included, as well as a nice announcement you should stick around until the end for :)<br>\nHere's what we have coming out of the oven:</p>\n<h4>Goal State Diffing</h4>\n<p>When the goal state changes in your proof, or as you introduce new hypotheses, Lean sends little hints saying which parts of your goal have changed.<br>\nThese can be subtle (I didn't even notice them myself until they were pointed out) but they're very helpful for watching your proof state change.<br>\n<code>lean.nvim</code> now supports showing them as well:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/GulONg8qkjl8ptXNOeBjkFJs/goaldiff.mp4\">goaldiff.mp4</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image message_inline_video\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/GulONg8qkjl8ptXNOeBjkFJs/goaldiff.mp4\" title=\"goaldiff.mp4\"><video preload=\"metadata\" src=\"/user_uploads/3121/GulONg8qkjl8ptXNOeBjkFJs/goaldiff.mp4\"></video></a></div><p>The precise colors you see will depend on your color scheme, but the defaults should be good enough, as they're <a href=\"https://neovim.io/doc/user/syntax.html#group-name\">tied to</a> the colors you should already see in other \"diff\" contexts.<br>\nIf that isn't the case, please feel free to share your setup.</p>\n<h4>Diagnostic Widgets</h4>\n<p><code>lean.nvim</code> previously supported interacting with hypotheses in the infoview (e.g. allowing you to click on a term you see and to see its type).<br>\nBut now it properly renders some widgets within <em>diagnostics</em>, which are sometimes used by commands you may already be familiar with.<br>\nAs a concrete example, here's what you should now see with the <a href=\"http://\"><code>#find_home</code> command</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/g_c6lwAD-Jjw9e2anpvBf37L/diagnosticwidgets.mp4\">diagnosticwidgets.mp4</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image message_inline_video\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/g_c6lwAD-Jjw9e2anpvBf37L/diagnosticwidgets.mp4\" title=\"diagnosticwidgets.mp4\"><video preload=\"metadata\" src=\"/user_uploads/3121/g_c6lwAD-Jjw9e2anpvBf37L/diagnosticwidgets.mp4\"></video></a></div><p>(Note that in the screencast I'm hitting <code>gd</code> to jump to definition -- this is because the widget coming from <code>#find_home</code> is specifically one meant for jumping to a corresponding Lean module being shown).</p>\n<h4>Mapping Documentation</h4>\n<p>Neovim key mappings can be <a href=\"https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_set_keymap()\">\"self-documenting\"</a>, in that when you run e.g. <code>:map &lt;LocalLeader&gt;\\\\</code> they can tell you not only that this is mapped to some command or Lua function, but also some documentation about what the mapping <em>does</em>.<br>\n<code>lean.nvim</code> now sets this property for all mappings it creates.<br>\nIn this particular case then, you'll now see:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Space</span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Space</span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;\\</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">*&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Cmd</span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span><span class=\"n\">LeanAbbreviationsReverseLookup</span><span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">CR</span><span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">                 </span><span class=\"n\">Show</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">how</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">to</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">type</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">the</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">unicode</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">character</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">under</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">the</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">cursor</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where the second line is new.<br>\nSimilar short descriptions are present for all of what <code>lean.nvim</code> binds both in Lean files as well as the infoview.</p>\n<p>Those of you who use <code>which-key.nvim</code> (which actually doesn't include me :) should now see something other than a blank spot in your popovers, as it's this same property which is used to generate the text there.</p>\n<h4>FRO Sponsorship <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></h4>\n<p>I am really happy to be able to share that the Lean FRO has decided to sponsor me working on <code>lean.nvim</code> part-time for a short period.<br>\nSincere thanks are definitely owed (to Leo, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110024\">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>  and many others in the FRO!)<br>\nAnd of course some of the existing work these last 2 weeks already is a direct outcome.</p>\n<p>While I feel like I have some decent sense of missing functionality that could be worked on in the coming weeks, please do take this as an official solicitation to <em>share pain points and gaps</em>.<br>\nI'll shortly share the list I have which I'm using to prioritize what to do next, but this list is malleable and definitely could use you (yes you!) throwing ideas in the hat to help me reorder priorities.</p>\n<p>I'd like to sincerely thank all of you who use it for showing how much interest there is!<br>\nUndoubtedly it was instrumental in making this specific sponsorship happen, and bodes well for Neovim and Lean being long term friends.</p>\n<h4>Other Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A default mapping was added for <code>:LeanRestartFile</code> (<code>&lt;LocalLeader&gt;r</code>). You of course are still free to map it to whatever you'd like if you prefer another mapping. Thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"296911\">@Utensil Song</span> for the contribution!</li>\n<li>Communication with the LSP should be <em>slightly</em> more reliable because we now do a few more retrys when we get a failure, though it's here that I actually want to make my next set of improvements.</li>\n<li>The infoview contains less trailing whitespace. This is something you may not have noticed if you're not as bothered by it as I am, but occasionally we would render extra empty trailing lines, and now we don't :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Until next time Neovim friends.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You should be able to update using whatever plugin manager you're using, e.g. via <code>:Lazy update</code>.</p>",

And I think perhaps that if upstream is OK with it that it's always nice to have 2 implementations of something. Again, not saying we won't or shouldn't do it anyhow, or that if we were starting today perhaps we'd even start there. But I don't think this decision is so closely related to @mars0i's question which is more about how or if we can support rendering arbitrary JS when not running inside of a browser (and in particular when running in a terminal). As you say maybe using an external one is an option there, but that kind of solution is always lower priority to me personally given that I wrote lean.nvim in part because I don't really want to leave the terminal for programming  :)</p>",

That's a great idea down the road.  In fact I didn't know that there was a real possibility of embedding a browser in nvim.  Kind of amazing to me, but I had wondered whether that might be a possibility, because nvim continues to surprise me.  </p>\n<p>What I was imagining more concretely was sending only the Infoview HTML/SVG/JS/etc. to a separate browser.  That might be a completely bad idea, or anyway not worth the trouble.  But it's kind of half of what Shanghe was discussing. Regardless, I certainly wouldn't want the current Infoview functionality to leave nvim.  This is one of the main things that makes using Lean so nice.</p>\n<p>I don't generally use nvim in a terminal.  I use the Goneovim GUI front end for nvim.  Not sure whether that supports Kitty graphics.  There are a couple of other nvim GUIs that I like; maybe one of them would.  On the other hand, if I have to use a different setup for plotting from Lean, I'd choose nvim in a terminal app over VSCode.  </p>\n<p>But for now it will be fine to use VSCode.  Not a bad idea for me to be familiar with it given its prominence in the Lean community.</p>\n<p>(No need to read this: I came to nvim from MacVim's GUI, which does some things that I like a lot. When I started using nvim instead of vim for coding, I tried out all of the terminal apps that people on the nvim Zulip chat suggested.  There was one basic function that's part of my workflow that wasn't possible because of a limitation in nvim--might have been fixed by now, but it wasn't a priority then.  It was also clear that I would have had to do quite a bit of experimentation and configuration to make nvim in any of the terminal apps look and function the way I was used to.)</p>",

Another new release of <code>lean.nvim</code> is out!<br>\nBy popular request, this one brings initial support for... autoindenting.</p>\n<h4>Autoindent</h4>\n<p>This hopefully should be self explanatory.<br>\nWhen you hit enter in places, or use other normal mode commands for creating lines like <code>o</code>, you should see the cursor automatically be indented in places which are stylistically expected.<br>\nSimilarly, using the <code>=</code> operator should indent code (e.g. <code>gg=G</code> indents all lines in the buffer, which I've used to test that many but not all files in <code>Mathlib</code> will no-op when run through <code>lean.nvim</code>'s autoindent support).<br>\nNote of course that given that Lean is whitespace sensitive that this <code>=</code> indentation is by nature \"impossible\" to do unambiguously for all cases, but it should do some right things some of the time.</p>\n<p>I'm calling this alpha level, as there certainly are (even known) cases which can be improved and it's very possible that there are still some significant issues to work out, but it's at a state where I'd like more feedback and I've been using it a bit the past few weeks.<br>\nPlease report any things you wish were indented, or things you wish weren't, as I've done a bit more than was originally requested here which can be both good or bad; in particular what good autoindentation feels like I find to often be slightly subjective and slightly hard to make precise -- so feedback as usual is welcome.</p>\n<p>(n.b. you'll find that I've implemented at least one case of auto<em>de</em>denting, specifically when you type <code>sorry</code> you'll find yourself automatically dedented. There's more we could do there, e.g. we could make use of goal states to decide whether to dedent automatically, but I chose for now to get a first version out even though I've played a bit with fancier logic for dedenting, especially given that if you don't like any of this behavior I'd be happy to make it configurable to turn off.)</p>\n<h5>Turning it off</h5>\n<p>If for whatever reason you notice undesirable indent behavior, let me know, but you also can completely disable the behavior by creating the file <code>~/.config/nvim/indent/lean.lua</code> and having it contain:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lua\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">vim</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">did_ident</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>which tells Neovim that this (empty) file is the indent rules for Lean.</p>\n<h4>Other Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A fix was contributed for users without <code>satellite.nvim</code> installed who weren't seeing progress bars show up</li>\n<li>blink.cmp support (an alternative completion plugin) was made more stable, avoiding a bug that might cause stack overflows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Until next time Neovim friends.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You should be able to update using whatever plugin manager you're using, e.g. via <code>:Lazy update</code>.</p>",

In <code>lean.nvim</code> this is done via <code>require('lean.lsp').restart_file()</code>, or via <code>:LeanRestartFile</code>.</p>\n<p>In fact there are two subtly different scenarios where Lean asks a user to intervene and run this command:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are editing <code>Foo.lean</code> and <code>Bar.lean</code> simultaneously, where the former imports the latter. You change and save <code>Bar.lean</code> with both files open in the editor. Lean will notify you via the editor in <code>Foo.lean</code> that dependencies have changed and you should restart <code>Foo.lean</code>.</li>\n<li>as above, <code>Foo.lean</code> depends on <code>Bar.lean</code>, but now external to being inside an editor, you run <code>lake build</code>, which generates <code>.olean</code>s. Then you change <code>Bar.lean</code> and save it, and then you open <code>Foo.lean</code> <em>without</em> regenerating an <code>.olean</code> for the modified <code>Bar.lean</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, it's in this second scenario where <code>lean.nvim</code> has different behavior from VSCode, but I'm strongly considering bringing it in line for consistency.<br>\nSpecifically, to peel back one implementation detail, VSCode sends  a setting to Lean which tells the server not to rebuild dependencies when a dependent file is opened. <code>lean.nvim</code> does not set this setting. This is why in VSCode in the second scenario above you can open a file and immediately get an error telling you you must run <code>Restart File</code> on <code>Foo.lean</code> to build its dependencies.</p>\n<p>(There's a subtle difference in Lean's messages, in the former it tells you you <em>should</em> restart <code>Foo.lean</code>, and in the latter it tells you you <em>must</em>).</p>\n<p>I suppose my question at the moment is: <em>does anyone have strong opinions one way or the other with changing this default to match VSCode</em>?</p>\n<p>If or when it's changed, my idea would be to introduce an <code>on_imports_out_of_date</code> config hook which one could instrument to automatically trigger running <code>Restart File</code> (in some sense this also enables an end-user to have Lean 3's behavior where you <em>never</em> have to run \"Restart File\" and you proactively always compile dependencies, though of course the reason Lean 4 works this way is that doing so can be very slow...).</p>",
