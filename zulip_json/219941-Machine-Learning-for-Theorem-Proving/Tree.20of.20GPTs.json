To be more specific, each node of the tree is a LLM. It inputs a sentence representing the current thought/state and outputs several next steps. I feel that the model mimics how a human solves a LEAN goal very well: when we see the current goal state, we think of several sequences of proof steps to make progress instead of only one sequence of proof steps. It would be exciting to incorporate this model into LEAN. Even nicer -- I saw the implementation on GitHub and it was quite easy, &lt; 400 lines of code I would say.</p>",
