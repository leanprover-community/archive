        "content": "<p>To me the most important aspects of this benchmark are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tests real-world Lean autoformalization.</strong> There are plenty of Lean proof benchmarks.  This should be focused on auto-formalization even if in some ways it is a secondary emergent property from this benchmark.</li>\n<li><strong>It is scored by proof correctness only.</strong>  This avoids all the issues most common with other autoformalization benchmarks where scoring is much more ambiguous and challenging. </li>\n<li><strong>It is hard.</strong>  The main benchmark should have proofs that contain lemmas or definitions in many of the proofs.  When formalized into Lean it will be more than just a small proof block (or a horribly long proof block if it is).</li>\n<li><strong>It avoids near future data leakage.</strong>  If you make the benchmark out of problems which will be formalized soon (what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Kim Morrison</span> calls the rising tide of Mathlib) then there is a real danger that these problems will be formalized and contaminate the benchmark.  So no work-a-day theorems, common theorems, famous theorems, etc.  Pick really non-standard stuff.  The subjects can be standard, and maybe should be, since they need to be formalized using existing mathlib definitions (or short non-mathlib definitions).</li>\n<li><strong>It is very carefully vetted.</strong>  The main issue with Lean/Rocq/Isabelle benchmarks are that they contain a lot (like  about a quarter in some cases) of misformalizations.  This can make problems too easy or impossible (and in this case, not fit the proof).  So problems need to be triple-checked for correctness.  Assumptions and edge cases need to be carefully vetted.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>Things I don't feel as strongly about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should there be an easier trial version to start?  This would be a version with no lemmas or definitions in the proofs.  The proofs would be short and simple.  The two obvious candidates are MiniF2F and ProofNet.  (PutnamBench could work too but may be more work since the proofs are probably in PDF format as pointed out to me by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"890706\">@Zeyu Zheng</span> .)</li>\n<li>How do we avoid copyright issues?  Probably the best solution is to link to papers or write proofs from scratch, but don't copy paper text.</li>\n<li>How to set up the tiers?  I envisioned three tiers.  Tier 1 was written by hand and self-contained.  Tier 2 was self-contained papers.  Tier 3 was non-self-contained papers.  Maybe this is too many or not the right levels.  (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Kim Morrison</span> pointed out that you could make a Tier 3 into a Tier 2 by including the prerequisite lemmas as assumptions to the main theorem.)</li>\n<li>Where to store stuff?  The simplest would be to make a repo.</li>\n<li>How to organize people and work?  Let's discuss here.</li>\n<li>Do we want training data or just test/benchmark data?  Training data is great if easy, but not necessary.  If for some reason one can easily come up with many examples, sure generate training data too.  But if not, then a testing benchmark is sufficient.</li>\n<li>How many examples?  I was envisioning 100 in each tier (if doing tiers), but that is open for discussion.  Fewer may be fine as it is so hard.</li>\n<li>Should we avoid images and scanned PDFs for now?  If so, then best to find public arxiv papers with LaTeX available (or our own written examples).  (Again, we only need a link to the arxiv, not to duplicate the text in the benchmark.)</li>\n</ul>",
