Possibly the only current events newsletter in the AI for formal methods space, we cover at least one LLMs-for-Lean paper in each issue. Plus a bunch of other stuff that's adjacent to Lean but not exactly lean. I thought some people in this channel might want to know! </p>\n<p>I'm rebranding the newsletter to focus more specifically on cybersecurity (and formal methods capabilities that get unlocked with AI, of course), probably starting in the next issue (which will be around christmas time most likely)</p>",
