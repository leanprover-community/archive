Author is working on project SmartGPT which is not open source yet . Love to test it out for Lean 4 . <br>\nI think there is already project sagredo  for Lean 4 but \"I think !?\" it is working more like AutoGPT, will be good for project if this approach is also included.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"wVzuvf9D9BU\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVzuvf9D9BU\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/0d3a7b84b3cf4d37234928dfd3acd266691f6118/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f77567a75766639443942552f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><p>Video Summery ( Creadits to Reddit Users and ChatGPT )</p>\n<p>The video presents SmartGPT, a new system designed to enhance the capabilities of GPT-4 by refining prompts and utilizing self-dialogue to obtain better outputs. It aims to showcase the full potential of GPT-4 beyond its benchmark results.</p>\n<p>SmartGPT guides GPT-4 through a step-by-step thinking process and encourages it to engage in self-dialogue. This method enables the model to reflect on its own outputs, making it more likely to identify and correct errors, leading to improved results.</p>\n<p>To generate a diverse range of responses, SmartGPT employs multiple outputs and adjusts the temperature settings. Different temperature settings influence the creativity and conservativeness of the model's responses, allowing it to explore various solutions to a problem.</p>\n<p>The Massive Multi-task Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark was used to test SmartGPT's performance. It showed that SmartGPT significantly outperformed GPT-4's zero-shot capabilities, indicating its potential for improved language understanding.</p>\n<p>The human expert level on the MMLU benchmark is 89.8. SmartGPT's performance suggests that it could potentially surpass this level, indicating that it might be able to compete with or even exceed human experts in language understanding tasks.</p>\n<p>The step-by-step prompting approach used in SmartGPT is inspired by a research paper published a year ago. This paper highlights the benefits of utilizing the input space for computation instead of relying solely on the hidden states of the model, which helps improve the model's performance.</p>\n<p>SmartGPT's success can be attributed to two main factors. First, it draws from a diverse dataset that includes step-by-step problem-solving examples. Second, it has the ability to reflect on its outputs and spot errors, allowing it to self-improve and generate better responses.</p>\n<p>The model could be further refined by improving the prompts used to guide its thinking, experimenting with different temperature settings to achieve a balance between creativity and conservativeness, and integrating basic tools that can help the model avoid simple errors.</p>\n<p>Gaining access to the GPT-4 API key would enable the automatic implementation of SmartGPT, making the system more efficient and user-friendly. This could potentially lead to a broader adoption of SmartGPT and further improvements to its performance.</p>\n<p>The video suggests that OpenAI may not have a complete understanding of its own models' capabilities, as evidenced by SmartGPT's performance. This highlights the need for more extensive testing and exploration of models like GPT-4 before their release, ensuring that their full potential is realized and appropriately utilized.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts ??</p>",

This leaves 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.</p>\n<p>USER:</p>\n<p>Let's critique our answer and consider other answer options.</p>\n<p>CHATGPT:</p>\n<p>Sure, I'd be happy to do that. Here are some critiques of the previous answers and some additional ways to measure six liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug:</p>\n<p>The first answer is correct, as it involves filling the 12-liter jug, pouring 6 liters into the 6-liter jug, and leaving 6 liters in the 12-liter jug. However, it's important to note that this method works because the 6-liter jug can hold exactly half of the volume of the 12-liter jug. If the jugs were different sizes, this method wouldn't work.</p>\n<p>The second answer is also correct, as it involves filling the 6-liter jug twice and pouring its contents into the 12-liter jug until it's full, leaving exactly 6 liters in the 6-liter jug. However, this method requires more steps than the first method.</p>\n<p>The third answer is incorrect, as it involves filling the 12-liter jug and pouring 6 liters of its contents into the 6-liter jug, but it doesn't account for the fact that the 6-liter jug will overflow if more than 6 liters are poured into it. This method would result in some of the liquid being wasted.</p>\n<p>Another method to measure 6 liters would be to fill the 6-liter jug and pour its contents into the 12-liter jug. Then, fill the 6-liter jug again and pour it into the 12-liter jug until the 12-liter jug is full. This leaves exactly 6 liters in the 6-liter jug.</p>\n<p>Another method would be to fill the 12-liter jug to the top, pour 3 liters into the 6-liter jug, and then pour the remaining 9 liters back into the original container. Then, pour the 3 liters from the 6-liter jug back into the 12-liter jug, and fill the 6-liter jug again. Finally, pour as much of the 6 liters from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug as you can, which will leave exactly 6 liters in the 6-liter jug.</p>\n<p>A final method would be to fill the 12-liter jug to the top, pour 5 liters into the 6-liter jug, and then pour the remaining 7 liters back into the original container. Then, fill the 6-liter jug again and pour its contents into the 12-liter jug. This will leave exactly 3 liters in the 6-liter jug. Repeat this step one more time, and you'll have 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.</p>\n<p>USER:<br>\nLet's compare and contrast our outputs and decide on a final answer.</p>\n<p>CHATGPT:</p>\n<p>Sure, let's compare and contrast the different methods for measuring 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug:</p>\n<p>Method 1: Fill the 12-liter jug to the top, pour 6 liters into the 6-liter jug, and leave 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.</p>\n<p>This method is the simplest and most straightforward.</p>\n<p>Method 2: Fill the 6-liter jug twice and pour its contents into the 12-liter jug until it's full, leaving exactly 6 liters in the 6-liter jug.</p>\n<p>This method is a bit more complex, but it still works.</p>\n<p>Method 3: Fill the 12-liter jug to the top, pour 6 liters of its contents into the 6-liter jug, and waste some of the liquid.</p>\n<p>This method is incorrect and wasteful.</p>\n<p>Method 4: Fill the 6-liter jug and pour its contents into the 12-liter jug. Then, fill the 6-liter jug again and pour it into the 12-liter jug until the 12-liter jug is full, leaving exactly 6 liters in the 6-liter jug.</p>\n<p>This method is similar to Method 2, but it requires a bit more pouring back and forth between the jugs.</p>\n<p>Method 5: Fill the 12-liter jug to the top, pour 3 liters into the 6-liter jug, and then pour the remaining 9 liters back into the original container. Then, pour the 3 liters from the 6-liter jug back into the 12-liter jug, fill the 6-liter jug again, and pour as much of the 6 liters from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug as you can, which will leave exactly 6 liters in the 6-liter jug.</p>\n<p>This method is a bit more complicated, but it uses a combination of pouring and refilling the jugs to arrive at the correct amount of liquid.</p>\n<p>Method 6: Fill the 12-liter jug to the top, pour 5 liters into the 6-liter jug, and then pour the remaining 7 liters back into the original container. Then, fill the 6-liter jug again and pour its contents into the 12-liter jug. Repeat this step one more time, and you'll have 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.</p>\n<p>This method involves pouring some of the liquid back into the original container, which may not be practical in some situations.</p>\n<p>Based on these methods, I would recommend Method 1 as the simplest and most straightforward way to measure 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug.</p>",
