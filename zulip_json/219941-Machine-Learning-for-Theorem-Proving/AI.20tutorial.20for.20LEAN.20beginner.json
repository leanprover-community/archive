        "content": "<p>Hi everyone:</p>\n<p>I started learning LEAN a few weeks ago motivated by the potential of AI to help mathematicians. My aim is to formalize math in my field (of Probability &amp; Statistics) with the ultimate hope that LEAN + AI might become an effective research assistant.  So from a perspective of a beginner user to LEAN (e.g. the user story of <code>Alice</code>  in  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"115715\">@Jason Rute</span>'s  talk at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Yr8dzfVkeHg?si=I7ddkU7TFi4GK2d9&amp;t=280\">Lean Together 2025</a>), I want to ask if there are any tutorials/documentation on AI tools that I can use to help me with learning LEAN and the formalization  process.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"Yr8dzfVkeHg\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Yr8dzfVkeHg?si=I7ddkU7TFi4GK2d9&amp;t=280\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/b6f6457a0ce3de21445be6f2de56ad6060528140/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f597238647a66566b6548672f6d7164656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><p>Currently, I am able to read and understand around 50% of LEAN code that I see online, however proof formalization still seems like a daunting task. I just came across <a href=\"https://www.leanexplore.com/\">LEAN Explore</a>, which seems useful to find relevant Mathlib libraries. For help just dealing with LEAN 4 syntax and debugging the formalized code, would Cursor or Github Copilot be useful? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"657719\">@Terence Tao</span>'s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TerenceTao27\">youtube channel</a> gives nice examples of this. </p>\n<p>To summarize, is there a webpage where  AI tools useful for beginners to learn LEAN are listed?</p>",

        "content": "<p>To revive this discussion, no, there isn't a website or other landing place (other than maybe this Zulip channel) to find this sort of information.  I think people have had the most luck with the following three categories of tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online search websites like <a href=\"https://www.leanexplore.com/\">https://www.leanexplore.com/</a>, <a href=\"https://leansearch.net/\">https://leansearch.net/</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.moogle.ai/\">https://www.moogle.ai/</a></li>\n<li>Off-the-shelf AI coding assistants, including Cursor, <a href=\"http://Continue.dev\">Continue.dev</a>, Tabnine, and GitHub Copilot, as well as chatbots from the major AI companies.  It matters a lot which specific model you use, including the exact model name and version number and whether or not it has a thinking mode.  Often, the older, default models are not the best ones.  See elsewhere on this channel for specific recommendations and user feedback about which models work best both for code assistants and chat bots.  (This information will of course change as newer models are released.)</li>\n<li>Powerful tactics (most of which don't use neural AI at all), like <a href=\"https://github.com/chasenorman/Canonical\">Canonical</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/JOSHCLUNE/LeanHammer\">Lean Hammer</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-auto\">Lean Auto</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/duper\">Duper</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ufmg-smite/lean-smt\">Lean SMT</a>, Grind, etc.  Many of these are so new (and others are still in development) that I don't think there is consensus on what problems they are good at solving.  (Honestly, I wouldn't mind a website just sorting out these various tactics.  I've become quite lost.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also a lot of research projects and papers, but most of those are not usable by average Lean users.  Kimina-Prover has a fairly user-friendly <a href=\"https://demo.projectnumina.ai/\">demo</a>, although it may not be user-friendly enough to be widely used.  DeepSeek-Prover v2 is open sourced and there are some demos, but I think to use it in practice, you have to find and put in their system prompt.  (Not a lot has changed since I gave my Last Mile talk. <span aria-label=\"frown\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f641\" role=\"img\" title=\"frown\">:frown:</span>)</p>",

Generally, strong mathematical intuition is required—currently, no amount of AI can replace it. The first step is to actually have the proof in my mind! After that, I try to decompose the proof into smaller steps. For each step, I try to guess if the AI can solve it automatically or not.</p>\n<p>If the step is dependent on algebraic manipulation, AI can solve it. If the step is dependent on choosing some special witness values (epsilon delta proofs <span aria-label=\"eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f440\" role=\"img\" title=\"eyes\">:eyes:</span>), AI can do it just fine. Or if I guess that the step can be solved by simple induction, AI can do it just fine. I then run DeepSeek Prover on the step 2 times in parallel, and choose the proof that works.</p>\n<p>If DeepSeek Prover starts writing in Chinese, or Russian, or being incoherent, I check whether the theorem statement I feed into DeepSeek is incorrect. Usually this involves using a more general purpose LLM like Gemini 2.0 Pro to do a sanity check. <del>I know I have a brain but I currently don't use it.</del> If it is, I refine the theorem statement, or conclude that the way I decompose the problem into multiple steps is wrong, and go back to the drawing board.</p>",
