Which have you found most capable? Are they something you commonly use in your work with formalisation? In particular, if a model has shortcomings, what are they? Are there certain areas of Mathematics that are easier for specific models? Most of all it would be good to hear about their performance on research Mathematics. Any concrete examples would be fantastic. Thanks.</p>",
