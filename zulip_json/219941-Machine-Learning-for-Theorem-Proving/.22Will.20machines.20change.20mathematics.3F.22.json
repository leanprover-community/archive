There is also a third class of invariants - those from Gauge theory. While the hyperbolic volume is indeed continuous, it would be just as useful to relate the Jones polynomial to say the Gromov/Thurston norm (which is discrete).</li>\n<li>This is important because the Quantum invariants are the most powerful in the sense of being able to distinguish knots, but the least geometric/topological so are often weak in terms of proving theorems.</li>\n<li>In a sense the result does not quite do this, since the Reidemeister signature is an Algebraic/Geometric topology invariant.</li>\n</ul>",
