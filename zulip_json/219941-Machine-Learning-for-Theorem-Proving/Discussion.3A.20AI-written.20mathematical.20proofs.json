When we build up theory in mathlib for some part of mathematics, we're not just building a text, but a common understanding of how and why that part of mathematics is set up that way in mathlib, what the design tradeoffs involved were, why one approach for expressing concepts formally works better than another, how certain kinds of statements and proofs should be expressed formally, what the common patterns are in statements and proofs that may lead to new definitions and lemmas and tactics that don't appear directly in the informal literature. So a key question for large-scale autoformalization would be how to use it without losing those things. (An AI might readily produce 1000 proofs based on awkwardly set up definitions, and indeed clean up those proofs so that each one is individually high-quality Lean, without complaining that there are common things that are inconvenient in many of those proofs that indicate the initial definitions and API would better have been set up differently.)</p>",

For instance, LLMs interacting with Lean via the lean-lsp MCP generate reasoning traces, code, error message logs, and other intermediate outputs. This means every proof attempt, strategy change, success, failure, and notation modification can be stored and inspected by both humans and other language models. I see no reason why insights extracted from these artifacts could not be used to influence how the LLM writes the final proof and what information is communicated in other domains.</p>\n<p>I would even argue that a mature version of this system (though none exists today) has an advantage in this regard. Humans have imperfect memories and chalkboards get erased. Everything the LLM does in this workflow is text that can be stored in a lossless, immutable, and transparent manner.</p>",

My concern is that if we're going to formulate an official policy, one needs to address the fact that there is not a clean separation between \"human-generated proof\" and \"AI-generated proof.\"</p>\n<p>For a concrete example, I was on the Robbins Prize committee when we decided to award the prize to the paper that proved the q-TSPP conjecture. During our deliberations, we worried a bit that the proof relied essentially on a Mathematica notebook, which (at the time anyway) was not something that just anyone could run; you had to pay for a Mathematica license (and even then, you don't get access to the source code). On top of that, when I tried to download and run everything, I found that there was a crucial component that I had to email one of the authors to obtain. Despite our reservations, we decided to award the prize anyway. Under the proposed policy, should we have declared that the \"proof\" was \"not a real proof\"? It was neither entirely \"human-generated\" nor entirely \"AI-generated\".</p>",

As mathematical writing becomes easier to produce I think we should shift a little more of the burden back onto the authors from the readers, not by having longer papers but by having some sort of supplemental formalization of the most delicate arguments, which may then liberate the natural language version to focus on details that are more high level.</p>",

For instance, I had to manually execute some terminal commands to meet permissions requirements on my machines, but did so at Claude Code's direction. I also did some manual editing to deal with linter warnings and other minor tasks of that nature. I estimate that I had Claude Code actively doing something for ~100 clock hours over the course of the last week. These claims warrant skepticism, which I welcome. To that end, I offer the following:</p>\n<p>The repo includes <a href=\"https://github.com/e-vergo/ChebyshevCircles/tree/main/Claude_Code_Chat_History\">this directory</a> which contains a complete chat history from every Claude Code session used while vibe-proving.

If I have done things correctly, this should contain every token both sent and received from Claude Code.

I cannot stress this enough: This is not false modesty, but recognition that the bar is high and I do not yet meet it. I am not qualified to judge whether this is a legitimate formalized proof. To put a fine point on it, the proof uses objects I have never encountered before, and there are statements and proof techniques I do not understand. There are things going on in Lean whose syntax and purpose I do not understand. Claude Code decided to use all of that and wrote all of the Lean without my understanding what was going on with the specifics.</p>\n<p>Despite all of that, I was able to make this with tools available today. I knew that the relationship between roots of unity and Chebyshev polynomials was correct before I started this project (it is a known and established relationship) but I have little to no confidence that what is contained in this repo accurately captures that idea.  I would go as far as to say that I was intentionally as careless as possible while \"vibe proving\" the repo, with the goal to \"get all the checkmarks and make it look good.\"</p>\n<p>All of that being said, the \"lesson\" is this: </p>\n<p>This is existence proof that, in some very limited sense, one can produce seemingly correct mathematical proofs in Lean via almost exclusively prompting a tool-using LLM. This should inform earlier discussion in this thread about the pace of change and potential volume problems facing the community.

Five?</li>\n<li>Can the Lean community handle 10 submissions like this a day? 100? 1,000?</li>\n<li>How soon will a language model be able to replace a human like me? Can it do that today? Has anyone tried?</li>\n<li>What if we simply don't have enough humans to review the rapidly increasing volume of submissions?</li>\n<li>Should we allow the humans we do have to use AI tools during submission evaluation? How might this go wrong?</li>\n<li>Are we going to enter an era of mass-produced mathematics? What does that look like? How do we prepare for it?</li>\n</ul>",

First, thanks for taking an initial crack at a list of best practices. I can imagine that a (suitably expanded and honed) version of this list could amass signatories and be published in something like the Notices of the AMS.</p>\n<p>Second, I think that one needs to distinguish between things that people should do, and things that should be explicitly discussed in the paper. Take the example of hallucinated references. Obviously, any reference suggested by an LLM should be verified, to avoid those egg-on-the-face situations where a nonexistent reference is cited. However, I'm not sure it makes sense for every paper to contain an explicit discussion of this point and an affirmation that the authors did the right thing. Quite apart from LLMs, people already do sloppy things like copy a reference from someone else's bibliography without checking that it's correct. This is bad practice, and a list of best practices should condemn it, but I don't think anything is gained from cluttering every paper with an affirmation that the authors didn't do this. On the other hand, there are some things that warrant explicit discussion, such as efforts to perform certain intricate calculations in at least two different ways to make sure the answer is correct.</p>\n<p>Third, while some of the \"best practices\" apply across the board to all kinds of tools, there are some that apply primarily if not exclusively to certain tools. It would be good for the list of best practices to have separate sections addressing different types of tools.

I know that I am a bit of an outsider here, so I would like to take a minor detour and tell you a bit about my background. I do this not to draw attention to it, but to share it with the hope that you fully understand where I am coming from, add some credence to my thoughts, and to give you confidence that I mean what I say. I know who all of you are and given the nature of the conversation I think it makes sense that you know who I am.</p>\n<p>In August of 2024 I was interviewed on a podcast, where I describe the process of leaving my mechanical engineering career at Apple to pursue mathematics. It is surprising how many things I say during that interview that are relevant to the conversation we are having right now, but the important part is said at the 13:00. (timestamped link at the end of this post, it lasts  5 mins). Additionally, in October of 2023 I wrote “<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240822095428/https://operationpcb.com/\">Math is now an Engineering Problem</a>” on my now defunct blog. The critical part of that post is this: </p>\n<p>“Just as Napster was the first warning shot to the music industry that everything was about to change, Sagredo is the first warning shot to mathematicians. </p>\n<p>While an incredible achievement, there are numerous opportunities to make this technology significantly more effective; specifically trained LLMs will do a better job of generating error free code, optimization will make the ‘discussion’ between the two subsystems faster, more compute will lead to speed ups. The list goes on. But that list is supplanted in importance by the following observation: everything on that list is a matter of engineering – not mathematics. And, in just the same way the LLM uses the iterative process to ‘engineer’ a proof, we will be able to apply the iterative process <em>to engineer the system itself.</em> What this means is that the ability of this system to produce proofs is a function of our ability to engineer the system, rather than our ability to understand mathematics – it’s engineering all the way down.”</p>\n<p>Is it fair to say that the repo I shared earlier in this thread was made with Sagredo++? I think it is. </p>\n<p>The core responsibility I had as an engineer was to take product designs/architectures which had been validated at low volume and get the product design refined to the point where it can be put into customers hands. This involved designing things that could be manufactured, sometimes in the many millions of units, while maintaining high quality standards. If my time as an engineer taught me anything, it’s that <a href=\"https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf\">more is different</a>. Different in a way that is not “we keep finding new corner cases that break the kernel” or “This process is the latest bottleneck in build time, that’s a first”. I mean different in a way that no one can predict, different in a way that simply cannot happen unless you are doing things at scale and have a large number of things interacting. When I looked at the coupling of large language models and formal verification systems, I saw something that could be automated and scaled, which led to that blog post. Based off of what I have seen between then and now, I fully expect the tools to become increasingly powerful. What happens as a result of that is very hard to predict.</p>\n<p>Like a lot of people here, I am drawn to and excited by the exacting and brutal standards that formal verification imposes. What excites me more is the fact that I will get to express my creativity while being grounded by Lean. LLMs will be a part of my workflow moving forward and it’s clear that this is true for others as well. I look forward to developing best practices around this that fully respect the rigor that Lean demands, and to do so in a way that increases accessibility while adhering to open source philosophies. I do not know “how to do this right”, and I don’t think anyone does. But we will figure something out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TZG1NiFKA&amp;t=780s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TZG1NiFKA&amp;t=780s</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"-3TZG1NiFKA\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TZG1NiFKA&amp;t=780s\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/f6b3c6edb6eb43a956c59a54e4ee3e7849e7189d/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f2d33545a47314e69464b412f6d7164656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",

Maybe the \"engineering versus mathematics\" cultural difference is causing some communication problems. From a mathematician's point of view, if the Lean code consistently compiles, then there are only two possible \"errors\": (1) the statement of the theorem is not what it seems to be, or (2) there is a major bug in Lean (or the trusted code base).

In the same way that journal submission teams are under-water from AI generated slop, we should assume that the team reviewing mathlib PRs will be too. It’s hard to say when this will happen, but it seems like something that we will face in the relatively near future. The tool Kim suggested will help, but there are serious problems caused by volume that this might not be able to counter. </p>\n<p>As for Emily’s proposal I am still in support of it, but there are arguments against it. For instance, this would further increase the number of AI generated mathlib submissions and add additional strain on that team.

First, and much less of a concern on my end, are end user mathematicians disclosing the use of “AI” tools, along with the logs and techniques used in doing so. Indeed, it is not the norm now that mathematicians publish failed attempts and time spent on wrong ideas. But I would argue that this is, in part, a function of the fact that doing so has been unavailable to mathematicians because of pragmatic constraints. But, the introduction of these tools significantly reduces the amount of work needed to execute on that, so maybe we should consider it. As others in the thread have noted, people may engage in undesired behavior when disclosing use in AI, and this needs to be taken into account. I don’t have solutions for much of, if anything highlighted here but do mirror the concerns that others have shared.</p>\n<p>The far greater concern, and the intent of my previous posts, is to push for full transparency from companies who are producing the tools that we are going to use. What I mean by that is this: right now we are relying on the good graces of frontier model makers to have access to things like reasoning traces, a full history of actions taken, outputs, intermediate artifacts, tool calls, logs, etc. There is no guarantee that they will do this in the future, and there are already examples of end users having unexpectedly reduced access to these types of things. I am deliberately not including examples to avoid finger pointing, but a quick search will confirm this. I’m bringing this up to illustrate a point: there are implicit assumptions being made that we will always have the option of inspecting every token involved in producing a proof, and the reality is that the option may not always be there.  I am not making the claim that we should make it the norm that mathematicians share all of their relevant LLM interactions moving forward, but I could imagine a future where it is. Moreover, if the norm settles at a ‘less invasive’ level some may want to still choose to share as much as possible. If that is something we want to enable, we should make that clear now. </p>\n<p>These companies are anticipating that this technology will allow them to capture trillions of dollars in value over the coming years. We should expect them to act in a way that is rational when evaluated against the incentive structures surrounding them. This is not ascribing malice to their actions, simply observing that they are operating in a competitive, high stakes environment.

They were written shortly after Holmes and Wilshaw announced the formal proof of the consistency of NF. Though the posts (and the accompanying comments/discussion) do not address LLM-generated content, they do address the role of ITPs in validating the correctness of mathematical proofs. In particular, Rowsety Moid expressed concerns about ITPs playing the role of a referee. Can ITPs be trusted, and even if they can, could their use damage mathematics by making mathematics less of a human activity?</p>\n<p>As you'll see if you click through and read everything, I disagree with much of what Rowsety Moid says, but if we are going to be pushing ITPs as a virtual referee or guardian, then it's important to understand what kinds of objections and pushback we might encounter.</p>",

The introduction of generative AI makes this point much sharper. I am not familiar with everything he has written but have been following his blog for a while. It's rare I find myself disagreeing with him, but I do expect the technology to get better much faster than he does. “<a href=\"https://siliconreckoner.substack.com/p/is-it-time-to-sell-out?utm_source=publication-search\">Is it time to sell out</a>” is one of his better pieces IMO and this line is particularly relevant: “But I have to confess that the prospect of foisting the work off on an AI agent, even Tao’s imagined GPT, looks deeply appealing.” I am deeply conflicted about this technology. The appeal is clearly there, but the concerns about what it will do to mathematics (and the world at large) are there too.</p>",
