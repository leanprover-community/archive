I asked it to prove a statement of the existence of a quotient map and I for example had no idea what was needed for the context. To my big surprise it generated a completely valid proof skeleton. Everything else was broken however.</p>\n<p>The proof skeleton itself was worth fixing though, as it compiled after an hour of tinkering. The funny thing is now that I have a compiling proof I gained much insight in what parts of the statement were crucial and which weren't. I thought that I needed an algebra homomorphism but the formalisation said a ring homomorphism is enough, which makes my life just a little bit nicer.</p>",
