One one hand, this is a metaprogramming question and there are tools like <a href=\"https://seasawher.github.io/mathlib4-help/tactics/#plausible\"><code>plausable</code></a> that do that sort of stuff (I think systematically instead of randomly).  They probably could be adapted for this use case.  But on the other hand, I’m curious what sort of examples you think it would help with.</p>",
