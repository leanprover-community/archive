While looking for various tools related to the topic of the channel, I've been wondering whether there is a tool that takes as input a string in natural language (say, \"Gauss Lemma\") and searches Mathlib for similar lemmas? Close to how Lean State Search gives similar tactics to a proof state.<br>\nI'm interested in all attempts and anything related to the subject.</p>",
