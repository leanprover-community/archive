It's worth noting that it was a bipartisan effort applauded by his predecessor.   The offshoring had hollowed out their ability to do important work.

I linked there just to say that there are people here (including myself) who might agree fully with your last two messages, and are discussing in the specific context of auto-formalization. Perhaps something missing from that discussion was how we can actually mitigate these risks in the world of formalization, e.g. maybe by emphasizing code quality/organization/maintenance/'golfing' (things which are already being done in mathlib) when teaching or introducing Lean, rather than \"just get the theorem proved and that's it\"?</p>",
