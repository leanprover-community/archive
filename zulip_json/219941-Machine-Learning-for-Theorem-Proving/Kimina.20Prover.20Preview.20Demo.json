You can go to <a href=\"https://demo.projectnumina.ai/\">https://demo.projectnumina.ai/</a> to try it out!</p>\n<p>This demo supports two main workflows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enter an informal math statement to autoformalize it using the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/AI-MO/Kimina-Autoformalizer-7B\">Kimina-Autoformalizer-7B</a> model.</li>\n<li>Input a formal statement directly to run proof search with 1 or 16 samples. Note that both the informal and formal statement is passed into the model.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One useful trick we found out is that you can enter a tactic state as an input to the autoformalizer and it will still generate somewhat reliable autoformalizations, which is easier than trying to write a formalization of your sublemma.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please note that this model is specialized in solving competition-style problems so it might not work particularly well on advanced mathematics. </li>\n<li>Sometimes autoformalizer can produce formal statements with contradictory assumptions.</li>\n<li>The model is trained on toolchain version 4.15.</li>\n<li>This is a preview model and it's a work in progress!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If not sure what to try, you can paste the following problem into the demo: \"Show that the period of $cos 2x$ is $pi$.\"</p>\n<p>We wanted to get this into the hands of people to see how people make use of this - we are happy to hear your feedback!</p>",

(you might get connection error when server is full)</p>",
