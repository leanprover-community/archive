One interesting avenue might be to explore hyperbolic LMs or RL agents (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02949\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02949</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01542\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01542</a>) given Mathlib's hierarchical structure (ditto for math in general), but I would love to hear people's insights into the current state and potential future of AI usable to mathematicians.</p>",
