However, the expressive nature of underlying logics and esoteric structures of proof documents impede machine learning practitioners from achieving a large scale success in this field. In this data description, we present a simple dataset that represents the essence of choosing appropriate proof methods in Isabelle/HOL. Our simple data format allows machine learning practitioners to try machine learning tools to predict proof methods in Isabelle/HOL, even if they are unfamiliar with theorem proving.</p>\n</blockquote>",
