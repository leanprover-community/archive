It’s common to lose and/or make up data, and the generated table layout is usually wrong.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>✘ <strong>Code-formatted data</strong> translation is poor. This seems like a special case of struggling with formatted text.

For example, hyperlinks are always lost, and the generated Latex doesn’t describe document hierarchy well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I got mathpix's PDF-to-Latex conversion working, but I haven't been able to get image-to-Latex (e.g. with a Snipped screenshot) to work at all.
