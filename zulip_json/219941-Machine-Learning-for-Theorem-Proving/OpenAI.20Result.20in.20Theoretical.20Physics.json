What I find interesting about that blog post is the following excerpt:  </p>\n<p>\"An internal scaffolded version of GPT‑5.2 then spent roughly 12 hours reasoning through the problem, coming up with the same formula and producing a formal proof of its validity\"</p>\n<p>They do not explain what that \"formal proof\" is or in what language it is, altough I suspect it might be Lean. Does anyone know more? The preprint only explains the theoretical physics result and does not explain, how that internal scaffolded version of GPT-5.2 works.</p>",

        "content": "<p>If it's Lean then I suspect it would have to be with a bunch more than what's in mathlib. From the paper:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key formula (39) for the amplitude in this region<br>\nwas first conjectured by GPT-5.2 Pro and then proved by<br>\na new internal OpenAI model. The solution was checked<br>\nby hand using the Berends–Giele recursion and was more-<br>\nover shown to nontrivially obey the soft theorem, cyclic-<br>\nity, Kleiss–Kuijf, and U(1) decoupling identities—none of<br>\nwhich are evident from direct inspection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>leading up to this is a lot of particle physics jargon. Since the authors are physicists, they will probably say \"formal proof\" for what people here would call \"informal proof\" (aka pen and paper proof). The paper also says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rest of this work is devoted to proving that the<br>\nconjecture (39) is correct. The proof uses ideas from<br>\ntime-ordered perturbation theory </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>so for doing this in Lean, that theory would need to be developed, and that is not exactly trivial. If that was done, I think it would also be announced (\"we have formalised particle physics in Lean!!!1!\")</p>",

So I'm very confident that whoever wrote this was using terminology as the way physicists would, and not how the formalisation community would.</p>",
