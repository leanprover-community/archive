This meant to serve two purposes, help newcomers to Lean (like myself) get better at formalizing proofs, while also creating a data set for machine learning.</p>\n<p>I started working on the sub project titled the \"baby-rudin-project\" <a href=\"https://github.com/lean-mine/baby-rudin-project\">link</a> about two days ago and will dedicate about 300-600 hours of my time to it over the course of the next year. </p>\n<p>If you have ideas for other textbooks we can work on, or just vague problem dumps (such as formalizing stack exchange elementary number theory) please don't hesitate to let me know!</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nVatsa</p>",
