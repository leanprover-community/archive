I sense Anthropic is more invested in developer ergonomics in general. Even without MCP (in fact, it chronically forgets its MCP tools). My experiences with both codex and gemini-cli have been more frustrating than productive, even though yes, they might be better at math. When Claude can't solve a problem, I just get it to summarize what it's learned and switch back to [web] Gemini/ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>And note- I am a Lean beginner, with little math experience.
