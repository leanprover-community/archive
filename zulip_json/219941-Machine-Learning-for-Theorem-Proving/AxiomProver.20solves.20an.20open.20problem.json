(Gowers was of course not the first person to make this distinction; for example, Gian-Carlo Rota discussed the same topic in <em>Indiscrete Thoughts</em>. Interestingly, Gowers thought that problem solvers didn't get enough respect, while Rota thought that theory builders didn't get enough respect.)</p>\n<p>Axiom Math is probably trying to say that Erdős problems can be categorized as \"problem-solving math\" and want to distinguish Fel's conjecture as being a different type of open problem. In my opinion, though, there's no sharp distinction between \"problem-solving math\" and \"theory-building math.\" Admittedly, I'd consider it highly significant if an AI could, for example, come up with a revolutionary new mathematical <em>concept</em> that rewrites the foundations of a subject, the way (for example) Grothendieck revolutionized algebraic geometry with the notion of a scheme (and related ideas). That would definitely be \"theory building\" and not \"problem solving.\" But the way the Axiom Math announcement is phrased makes it sound like the <a href=\"https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2020.html\">mathematics subject classification</a> number of a conjecture automatically dictates whether its solution constitutes \"problem solving\" or \"theory building,\" and I don't think that's right. There may indeed be something qualitatively different about this latest result, but if there is, I don't think it's best characterized using the word \"theory-building.\"</p>",

The processes of abstraction and generalization are therefore very important as a means of making sense of the huge mass of raw data (that is, proofs of individual theorems) and enabling at least some of it to be passed on. The results that will last are the ones that can be organized coherently and explained economically to future generations of mathematicians. Of course, some results will be remembered because they solve very famous problems, but even these, if they do not fit into an organizing framework, are unlikely to be studied in detail by more than a handful of mathematicians.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There are innumerable cases of problems that initially looked easy but turned out to be hard. Less commonly, but still not that rare, a problem may resist solution by many people but then turn out to have a short and simple solution.

I don't know if this is true, and even if it is, I again don't think this automatically means that the conjecture was \"harder\" than the Erdős problems. (For comparison, imagine proving a result about finite simple groups by a straightforward case-by-case verification, using the classification. I would be inclined to call the proof of such a corollary \"easy\" even if there is no other known proof.)

MacGyver solves problems using great ingenuity, using whatever tools are at hand, even if they are very primitive. The Borg assimilates everything that can be assimilated. So what makes a problem hard? Is it that it requires incredible ingenuity? Or is it that there is no realistic way to solve it without standing on the shoulders of giants? It sounds to me that Axiom Math's claim is more in the direction of the Borg than in the direction of MacGyver.</p>",
