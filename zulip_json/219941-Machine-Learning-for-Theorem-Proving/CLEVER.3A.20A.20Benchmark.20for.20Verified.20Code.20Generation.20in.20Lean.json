As interest grows in connecting language models with formal reasoning, we believe there's value in having a benchmark that tests the ability to generate not just Lean code, but <strong>fully verified programs</strong>—starting from natural language.</p>\n<p>We’re introducing <strong>CLEVER</strong>, a benchmark of 161 programming tasks designed to study <strong>end-to-end, machine-verified code generation</strong> in Lean.</p>\n<p>Each task follows a two-phase process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Specification Certification</strong>: From a natural language prompt, generate a Lean specification and prove it equivalent to a hidden reference specification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Implementation Certification</strong>: Given the verified specification, generate a Lean implementation and prove that it satisfies the spec.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All verification is performed by <strong>Lean’s type checker</strong>, with no external evaluation. A key benchmark design choice is that all specifications are written as <strong>non-computable propositions</strong>. This prevents direct execution or leakage of implementation logic into the spec, and ensures models must engage in genuine symbolic reasoning rather than mirroring or approximating behavior.</p>\n<p>We release baseline results using large language models and a neuro-symbolic proof agent to help frame the current landscape.</p>\n<p>Resources:<br>\n• Paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13938\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13938</a><br>\n• Code &amp; Benchmark: <a href=\"https://github.com/trishullab/clever\">https://github.com/trishullab/clever</a><br>\n• Dataset: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever\">https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever</a><br>\n• Proof Agent (COPRA): <a href=\"https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover\">https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover</a></p>\n<p>Thanks to co-authors <strong>Jasper Lee, George Tsoukalas, Meghana Sistla, Matthew Zhao, Stefan Zetzsche, Greg Durrett, Yisong Yue, and Swarat Chaudhuri</strong>.
