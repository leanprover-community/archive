For example, maybe you need <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">1/2 &lt; 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1/2</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span>, but it formalizes it as:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">theorem</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">half_less_than_one</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">:=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">by</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">norm_num</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>which, while a correct theorem, is a misformalization.
