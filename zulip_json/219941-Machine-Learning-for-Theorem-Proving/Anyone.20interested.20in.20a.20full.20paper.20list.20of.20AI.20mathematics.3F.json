        "content": "<p>Hi friends, I am considering to create and maintain a full paper list for the AI4Math area, and would like to know whether you are interested in it or have any suggestions.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are some very helpful resources (I downloaded all papers from those lists and many thanks!), such as <a href=\"https://github.com/zhaoyu-li/DL4TP\">https://github.com/zhaoyu-li/DL4TP</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/j991222/ai4math-papers\">https://github.com/j991222/ai4math-papers</a>. However, it seems that they do not cover all subfields of AI mathematics. For example, I read <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07622\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07622</a> to find more AI math papers and it seems some papers are not on the GitHub paper list. I guess it is because those papers are out of the scope of the existing paper lists.</p>\n<p>The reason why I (personally) needs a full paper list is as follows. I heard several times that, if you have a research idea, then you need to carefully \"blanket search\" <em>all</em> existing papers, ensuring no one paper has done something same as you. Those papers can not only be on top conferences, but also can be hidden somewhere deep... Therefore, I guess the first step is to find all papers of AI mathematics, and read/filter them afterwards. I choose to open-source this, because I guess this may be helpful for other researchers in the AI mathematics field. Since I am new to research, it may be completely wrong (e.g. I do/should not need to do this?), and I would appreciate it for any suggestions!</p>\n<p>My very naive thoughts to construct the list is as follows, and again would appreciate it for any suggestions!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scrape the metadata of all arxiv/ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/ACL/... AI papers.</li>\n<li>Use regular expressions and some machine learning (probably LLM fine-tune or prompting) to find out the ones related to AI math. (The manual reading in the next step will provide data for this step's machine learning as well)</li>\n<li>Then, read the title/abstract of each and every paper manually as an extra filter.</li>\n<li>The output will be a JSON + a human-readable text, such that you can both directly read it (via text) and import it to your workflow (via JSON).</li>\n</ul>",

Hammers have some premise selection (using for example Naive Bayes).  The early work of Josef Urban usually used non-neural methods.  TacticToe, Tactician and others are non-nueral but quite good nonetheless.</li>\n<li>There are also a lot of related works like planning, robotics, and anything with the word reasoning in it.

I get the impression that biology/medicine/psychology is generally quite strict about thoroughly canvassing what's been done before. I think this in part because people care about replication, and cherry picking: it could be easy to select a few related studies that support your claim, and skip the ones with counter-evidence. And because establishing intellectual priority ends up being a big thing for patent reasons, which has bled over into standards in scientific publishing.</p>\n<p>This is different from e.g. math, where priority is usually pretty clear (at least for anything published in the last thirty years). If you prove a theorem last year, and then this year I (unaware of your work) prove the same result... well, my work is mostly redundant, but there's no question that you proved it first. Compare this with medicine, where (say) the claim \"Alzheimers is caused by an inflammatory response in glial cells\" could be something that people come to believe and \"prove\" only over the course of forty separate studies trying to get separate circumstantial evidence. Many of those forty papers will individually claim that have ... well, they wouldn't say \"proof\", but that they have \"strong evidence\" for their claim.</p>",
