        "content": "<p>My naive model is that building an automatic math reasoning system is hard because (a) maths is hard and (b) systems are poor at rigorous reasoning. My belief in (a) is based on decades of experience but it might be wrong, I might be underestimating AI. </p>\n<p>But (b) is certainly currently true right now. There's a dichotomy between informal and formal models. Current informal models can be good at \"solving high-level problems\" but these problems are always of the form \"give a short answer which can easily be graded by a computer\" (e.g. \"how many complicated math things have this complicated property, the answer is less than 10^10\") and it seems to me that it's extremely difficult to write such a problem where getting the right answer is a proof that the model has done rigorous reasoning accurately; it might have just become a good guesser. A question for which the solution is a succinct witness to the proof that you have actually done a lot of accurate mathematical reasoning correctly (including proofs) is a question which is doing a remarkable compression task and these are hard to come by. My belief is that the informal community are slightly confused right now, conflating \"our system got the number right for this question which most PhD students couldn't even understand (because they work in a different area)\" with \"our system is actually doing high-level mathematical reasoning correctly\".</p>\n<p>As for formal systems, here the level is much lower. The area is still in its infancy, you have to choose a formal system, if you want to do math then probably Lean is the best choice given the canonical math library, but even this library (mathlib) does not even cover most of the definitions in modern research due to its \"from the ground up\" approach and the fact that we have reached a major bottleneck in getting stuff into the library (amount of material appearing in the library is still growing more than linearly, but amount of PRs backed up and not being merged is also growing more than linearly). A concrete consequence of this is that there are many math questions which an informal model could spout out an answer to but which could not even be formally stated in Lean. But even if the library did contain a lot of modern definitions, the technology is still not there; Kimina's demo <a href=\"https://demo.projectnumina.ai/\">https://demo.projectnumina.ai/</a> is very nice and can reliably translate informal questions at easy school level into Lean and then autonomously find Lean proofs, but its level right now is \"sub-IMO\"; DeepMind's model AlphaProof can (apparently -- this is closed source with no way to play with it) solve IMO-level problems but we've seen no evidence that it can get to undergraduate mathematics (although one would guess that right now it can do this). As I already said, it's hopeless to think that these systems can be used on most open math problems because they cannot be stated in either Lean or any other system, although this will change; however we are still a year or two at least away from AI systems being able to reliably prove theorem autonomously. I think an easier question is to get a system to translate a human mathematical proof into Lean and even this is hard. I have been publically running my FLT project for several months now and I've not had anyone attempting to use their AI system to solve any of the tasks which I give out on the project dashboard (tasks are all of the form \"translate this informal LaTeX proof into Lean\"); it's always humans that claim them.</p>",

It was a total mess. Paul Gordan would do a calculation, and Max (and Emmy) Noether would write up the actual proof, and they didn't actually fully grasp what was going on (and the proofs are today totally opaque). Hilbert's first proof of his famous basis theorem was wrong, Gordan 'refereed' it, believed the theorem but pointed out the proof was not up to scratch, and Hilbert got salty and told the journal to publish it anyway, which it did. I can't recall the mathematician, but it was someone famous, who would read a paper of Riemann, believe the theorem, but work out their own proof because they couldn't grasp Riemann's. People in Berlin weren't familiar enough with the methods used by Göttingen mathematicians to understand their proofs. People in Germany didn't read proofs by mathematicians in England. We know the famous papers from the time, today, because they have been digested and understood and form the basis for our own thinking. But the average paper at the time was super flaky.</p>\n<p>What is incredible is the advances people made at that time <strong><em>in spite</em></strong> of this super non-rigorous and hodge-podge mathematical culture. Train an LLM the entirely of the pre-1850 mathematics literature and it would likely produce the kind of garbage you would invariably get as of a few years ago.

This isn't to say that such data can't <em>eventually</em> be found, created, or something synthetic done that is close enough to the real thing.</p>\n<p>The same problem exists with \"thinking tokens\" in the new generation of reasoning LLMs. The base models are trained on e.g. textbooks, solution guides, etc that present a way to do things, free of errors. There is almost no natural data online of someone starting to answer a question, noticing an error mid-sentence, and change course and try again.</p>\n<p>Key word: almost. There are a few examples of this, e.g. from video transcripts of someone talking through a problem live. There are discussion threads where someone corrects their post, in another post later.</p>\n<p>And, certainly, some major labs wrote synthetic examples of self-reflection in the face of errors and course correction. (We may never know exactly what methods were used to jump start the RL for thinking, but there are many reasonable guesses that probably all help.)</p>\n<p>I think there's a similar picture for \"the process of discovery\" (be that mathematical, scientific, philosophy, literary criticism...) that looks largely the same, maybe just with lots of numbers about ten times bigger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In agreement here: I think actually the lack of training data on human problem solving process is not so important. The recent progress in reasoning models have not come from finding much more human data but from better training paradigms. In that light probably it's safe to assume that, as with all other fields, AI progress in math research will not slow down dramatically just because it is approaching human-expert level. Especially given reinforcement learning is expected to \"just work\" eventually on formal math.</p>",

There is so much hype surrounding AI. Even if AI does become as good (or better) at proving theorems than humans, there is a question of how we can trust its work.  There is a somewhat funny quote related to this in the previous Scientific American article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While sparring with o4-mini was thrilling, its progress was also alarming. Ono and He express concern that the o4-mini’s results might be trusted too much. “There’s proof by induction, proof by contradiction, and then proof by intimidation,” He says. “If you say something with enough authority, people just get scared. I think o4-mini has mastered proof by intimidation; it says everything with so much confidence.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having AI output its work in a formal language like LEAN can obviously guard against this. Indeed, if we have a powerful AGI that can do math, why would we want anything less than formal proofs for its claims?</p>",
