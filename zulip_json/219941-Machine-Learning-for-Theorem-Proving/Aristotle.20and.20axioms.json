But I converted everything as I described in the original message, i.e. axioms to implications and it all worked out fine.  Aristotle is remarkable!  At first I used all my lemmas which I had developed when doing everything by hand.  Then, just for fun, I asked Aristotle to prove the main theorem directly which previously had taken me several pages of code, and it (he/she/they?) delivered a dense proof in about 10 lines.  I then stated two more theorems and Aristotle proved them also in short order.  Takeaway lesson: first try to let Aristotle do _everything_ before doing any work.  I guess the downside is that the formal proof carries none of the geometric intuition of the original.  Which raises all sorts of interesting philosophical questions.....</p>",
