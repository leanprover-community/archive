I feel strongly that mathematics (especially formal) is a very important step to AGI. My math background is weak and rusted, only learned about linear algebra, discrete math,  abstract algebra and real analysis (badly). My AI/ML experience is limited to AI accelerators.</p>\n<p>How may I start? Can you recommend papers/labs/researchers to pay attention to?   Any tip on applying to graduate school?</p>",
