So I am also a proponent of the argument that a trusted verifier is a necessary tool to move these things beyond where they are now.</p>\n<p>I think the video at <a href=\"https://epoch.ai/frontiermath/tier-4\">https://epoch.ai/frontiermath/tier-4</a> is quite illuminating too. Daniel Litt points out that the reason that LLMs can sometimes get hard \"what is this number\" questions right is that it can sometimes be much easier to guess the answer than to prove that your guess is correct. The \"FrontierMath philosophy\" of asking for questions for which you necessarily have to do some hard mathematics correctly and yet the answer is a number, is like asking mathematicians to come up with some kind of amazing compression algorithm, where a very small amount of data (the final answer, a number) is supposed to represent a proof that the model must have done a large amount of deep reasoning accurately. This is a hard problem to solve (which is why Epoch AI are offering $7500 to anyone who can give an example I guess).</p>\n<p><del>Another trick I saw recently coming from the \"guess the right number\" proponents is a test which was run at \"pass@3200\" which apparently is code for \"let the model guess the number 3200 times and it is deemed to get the answer right if it gets it right at least once\". </del>(I retract this claim: I suspect I was thinking about <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00212\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00212</a> which is not about \"guess a number\")</p>\n<p>However there are problems with getting models to write Lean code, for example there is not enough data to train on. It would be nice if we had more details about what DeepMind did but there is still no paper on AlphaProof and instead we have articles like <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/4i6C8Gc\">https://on.ft.com/4i6C8Gc</a> , which does not bode well from the point of view of an academic. Again in the EpochAI video, Sergei Gukov stresses the importance of autoformalization; if we can make great progress here then perhaps the idea of getting LLMs to write Lean code will become closer to a reality, as there will be far more data to train on.</p>",

Because of this, I have a hard time imagining a scenario where models regress. It seems more likely that the boundary capabilities of what these models are capable of will quickly expand until we reach a point where we can no longer easily check their work.
