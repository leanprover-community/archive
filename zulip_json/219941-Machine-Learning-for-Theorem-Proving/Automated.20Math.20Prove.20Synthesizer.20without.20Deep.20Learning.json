This stuff is truly incredible and the future.</p>\n<p>Also, he is looking for talents to join him. If somebody here is passionate about building out an automated theorem prover without deep learning, please reach out to him. He seems to have issues to find talented people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1881392823246729640\">https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1881392823246729640</a></p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<p>He built a massively parallel compiler based on interaction nets that enables true type enumeration and very fast program / proof synthesis based on logical constraints and / or input and output examples. Truly incredible stuff.</p>",
