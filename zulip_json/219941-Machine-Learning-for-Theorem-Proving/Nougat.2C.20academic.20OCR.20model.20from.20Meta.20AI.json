However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human-readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>h/t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1696107275570843667\">https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1696107275570843667</a></p>\n<p>Discussion about images of academic papers/books as data source for AI started <a href=\"#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving/topic/LLM.2BITP.28.2BAZ.29.3F/near/352132058\">here</a>.</p>",

I could not help but notice the repetition problem described in Section 5.4 that the model tends to repeat its previous sentences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We notice that the model degenerates into repeating the same sentence over and over again.  The model can not recover from this state by itself. In its simplest form, the last sentence or paragraph is repeated over and over again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another study, titled \"Learning to Break the Loop: Analyzing and Mitigating Repetitions for Neural Text Generation\" (link: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02369.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02369.pdf</a>), discussed the reason of repeating sentences. The repeated words seem to have a higher probability of appearing in the next generated text.... </p>\n<p>There were similar thread posts on Reddit about ChatGPT repeating itself. A common suggestion is to use ChatGPT's <code>frequency_penalty</code> parameter to help control the number of repeated words in the generated texts. Interesting!</p>",
