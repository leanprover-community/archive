No subscription required as everything is pay as you go.  There was a 50% discount on gpt5 last week, which was quite nice.   Also, new and highly capable models are being released weekly at this point and it has a very good chat interface with pinning.   </p>\n<p>Just released QwenMax (scores 100% on AIME2025 with tools) is also now on openrouter and I'm curious how it will perform.  <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-max\">https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-max</a></p>\n<p>In order to keep costs down, I will frequently switch to a cheaper model for certain prompts, many of which are free and don't consume as much power/water per prompt (I consume about one 5m shower per day in AI usage on average).    Do be warned however, the free models do not have Zero Data Retention (ZDR) and are training on your prompts (which they state clearly).</p>\n<p>My monthly spend ends up being quite low on openrouter, even with very heavy agentic usage - one of the reasons I dropped the openai pro account for $200 monthly.   And I also get the benefit of trying out every model as it is released.   </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://requesty.ai\">requesty.ai</a> is a competitor that seems to offer a comparable service, but I do not use them.</p>",
