I am involved in another project where modern AI has not been super effective but we cracked an open problem with a sat solver. Neurosymbolic AI is an  active area of research. Secondly as you yourself point out LLMs tend to generate and use Python programs for tasks. That’s explicitly symbolic and is done because  by themselves LLMs can’t even compose functions properly (it’s a bit more complicated, but that’s the gist). </p>\n<p>Classical AI is all around you. You might use lake for working with lean. It has and will eventually have an even more complex dependency management system. You use git which produces diffs that somehow magically match the edits you make to a file. You use lean tactics to write proofs. All that is the product of research in GOFAI. Lean integrates SMT solvers through lean SMT and ships with cadical, a SAT solver.  They just don’t get labelled AI because LLMs have hijacked that term. </p>\n<p>Outside math, even today, many business use cases of AI are served by traditional ML algorithms. Google maps is not using modern AI for navigation.</p>",
