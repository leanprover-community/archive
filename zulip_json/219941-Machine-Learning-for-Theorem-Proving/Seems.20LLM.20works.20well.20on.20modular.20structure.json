However, if you allow them to build out a framework incrementally, the complexity ceiling of the APIs they can successfully complete increases dramatically.</p>\n<p>Another thing I've found: an LLM is far less likely to succeed when trying to fill in a small <code>sorry</code> for an API within a single, several-hundred-line file than it is when that same small proof is isolated in its own file.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have more extensive, practical experience with this? I feel that exploring simple, pragmatic methods to enhance the performance of LLMs for writing Lean code is a fascinating and valuable topic for the long run.</p>",

In my limited experience, giving an LLM agent access to information from the Lean compiler and the type signatures of Mathlib APIs can significantly reduce many low-level errors.</p>\n<p>I was wondering, are there any official plans for a \"Lean MCP\" or any development initiatives aimed at making it easier for LLMs to interface with Mathlib?</p>",
