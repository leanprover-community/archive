I will give two talks per week <a href=\"https://discord.gg/AnHKcDm\" title=\"https://discord.gg/AnHKcDm\">on Discord</a> and generally will help beginners. The idea is that a student should, at the end of it, have a github repository containing working Lean code, and a little write-up explaining what they have done. </p>\n<p>Far more details are <a href=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/UROP2020.html\" title=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/UROP2020.html\">here</a>. Things will only get going at the end of June, but I'm setting this up now because people are asking what to do next.</p>",
