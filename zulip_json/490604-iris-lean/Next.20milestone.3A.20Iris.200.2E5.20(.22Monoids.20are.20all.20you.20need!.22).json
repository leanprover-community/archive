I figured it would be wise to post an update with the status of the project, and write down how all of the pending PR's relate to each other. </p>\n<h2>Where we are going</h2>\n<p>We are within striking distance of being able to develop program logics with fixed, first-order ghost state for sequential languages in iris-lean. I'm personally calling this version of the logic Iris 0.5 (because it can sort-of support half of the famous Iris tagline) even though the features we have ported don't exactly linearize into the Iris genealogy. For example, Iris 0.5 won't be able to express invariants yet, but it will have enough to define a weakest precondition inside the logic itself which is one of the super powerful concepts introduced in Iris 3. </p>\n<h2>Where we are now</h2>\n<p>To get to Iris 0.5, we need the following features, which are in varying states of done-ness: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The agree CMRA (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/41\">iris-lean#41</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"221679\">@Leo Stefanesco</span>, done).  </li>\n<li>Löb induction (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/50\">iris-lean#50</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"721721\">@Markus de Medeiros</span>, done). </li>\n<li>BI derived connectives (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/44\">iris-lean#44</a>, depends on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/50\">iris-lean#50</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"721721\">@Markus de Medeiros</span>, done). </li>\n<li>COFE fixpoints (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/45\">iris-lean#45</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"721721\">@Markus de Medeiros</span>, done).</li>\n<li>UPred soundness (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/46\">iris-lean#46</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"721721\">@Markus de Medeiros</span>, done).</li>\n<li>OwnM lemmas (also iris-lean <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/46\">#46</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"721721\">@Markus de Medeiros</span>, done).</li>\n<li>Local updates (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/49\">iris-lean#49</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"394485\">@suhr</span>, done). </li>\n<li>Updates (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/61\">iris-lean#61</a>, depends on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/49\">iris-lean#49</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"394485\">@suhr</span>, done). </li>\n<li>Frac CMRA (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/pull/56\">iris-lean#56</a>. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"466334\">@Shreyas Srinivas</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"721721\">@Markus de Medeiros</span>.

You can look at Mario's commit history to see the kind of changes he usually makes. </p>\n<p>If you want to help clean up any of the proofs, please make a PR into the appropriate branch. I'll deal with rebasing all of the downstream PR's and making sure everything works together. </p>\n<p>Thanks again for everyone who is helping with the project!

Namely, there are quite a few example where we've implemented a CMRA but we're missing A) their updates or B) their functors. The Auth CMRA (and the related CMRA's in <code>algebra/lib/*_auth</code>) also open up once the chain of PR's is merged. </p>\n<p>There is also the CSum CMRA, the STS CMRA, the list CMRA... these are examples of CMRA's which have no dependencies (aside from updates whose lemmas can be skipped) and which aren't strictly necessary but would be nice to port. </p>\n<p>As for a more substantial task: someone could take on generalizing step indexing. This will break a lot of stuff so it's probably better to deal with that soon, but porting <code>stepindex.v</code> and <code>stepindex_finite.v</code> are non-breaking and a good first step.</p>",
