I've also been in contact with Ralf and Max about a student at ETH who might want to help the effort. As for more introductory tasks, there are plenty of CMRA's that we have not yet ported, and would introduce someone new to Iris as a whole. There is also the challenge of porting the language hierarchy, which <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"246591\">@Quang Dao</span> was working on at one point. Of course, there will also be plenty of things to port inside the logic once we get the tactics working.</p>",
