It'll be good to have somewhere central to discuss this project. </p>\n<p>For people who want to contribute I think that there's a number of results that are within reach: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lemmas about (C)OFE's from <code>ofe.v</code> and CMRA's from <code>cmra.v</code>, many of which are self-contained</li>\n<li>The definition of the UPred CMRA, and the connectives defining a <code>BIBase</code> instance </li>\n<li>oFunctor/rFunctor instances, we have a definition for oFunctors and the fixpoint theorem but no instances! </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once more <code>COFE</code> and <code>CMRA</code> lemmas are ported, much more of <code>algebra/</code> will be accessible: <code>local_updates.v</code>, <code>algebra/lib/</code> etc. </p>\n<p>If anyone else has any ideas of easy tasks to point people to maybe you can put them here too. Sadly I'll be too busy to contribute for the next few weeks but I'm hoping to pick it back up afterwards!</p>",
