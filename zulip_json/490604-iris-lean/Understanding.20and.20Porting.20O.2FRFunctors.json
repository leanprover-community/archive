I haven't been able to go off Agree.lean since its functors have not yet been ported. Furthermore I struggle to gain much of an intuition with regards to the O/RFunctors just by reading the definitions in OFE.lean and CMRA.lean. Does anyone know how these functors should be ported?</p>",

The O/RFunctors are typeclasses on top of <code>COFE.OFunctorPre</code>, which should correspond to the <code>oFunctor_car</code> or <code>rFunctor_car</code> fields in Rocq. For <code>excl</code> You should be able to prove an instance of  <code>RFunctor</code> and <code>RFunctorContractive</code> with your <code>OFunctorPre</code> as the parameter. </p>\n<p>We do have one example of porting functors in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/iris-lean/blob/b1c209607c8c93fffaeadb8d810d3e535340689b/src/Iris/Algebra/UPred.lean#L66\">UPred.lean</a> to give you an idea of what it might look like.</p>",
