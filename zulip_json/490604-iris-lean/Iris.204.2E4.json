Iris is a<br>\nconcurrent separation logic framework for Rocq; for an overview of the numerous<br>\nresearch projects employing Iris, see <a href=\"https://iris-project.org/\">https://iris-project.org/</a>. std++ is an<br>\nextended “standard” library for Rocq.</p>\n<p>The main new Iris features are support for transfinite step-indexing for<br>\nresource algebras, and new proof rules for reasoning about propositions of the<br>\nform <code>∀ .. own</code> and <code>own .. ∧ own ..</code>. Otherwise, these releases mostly include<br>\nquality of life improvements.</p>\n<p>For Iris, the supported Rocq versions are 8.19 - 9.0, while std++ also supports<br>\nversion 8.18.</p>\n<p>For further details, see the full changelog of Iris at<br>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#iris-440-2025-06-04\">https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#iris-440-2025-06-04</a><br>\nand std++ at<br>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1120-2025-06-04\">https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1120-2025-06-04</a>.</p>\n<p>This release was managed by Jesper Bengtson, Ralf Jung and Robbert Krebbers.</p>\n<p>std++ received contributions from Andres Erbsen, Kimaya Bedarkar, Marijn van<br>\nWezel, Michael Sammler, Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, Rodolphe Lepigre, Rudy<br>\nPeterson, and Marijn van Wezel.</p>\n<p>Iris received contributions from Benjamin Peters, Daniel Nezamabadi, Ike Mulder,<br>\nIsaac van Bakel, Jan-Oliver Kaiser, Janggun Lee, Johannes Hostert, Lennard<br>\nGäher, Michael Sammler, Paolo G. Giarrusso, Pierre Roux, Ralf Jung, Robbert<br>\nKrebbers, Rodolphe Lepigre, Sanjit Bhat, Tej Chajed, Travis Hance, William<br>\nMansky, Yixuan Chen, Yiyun Liu, Yusuke Matsushita, Rudy Peterson, and Thomas Somers.<br>\nThanks a lot to everyone involved!</p>\n<p>Both packages are available in the Rocq opam registry. For further information<br>\nand installation instructions for Iris and std++, see the respective project<br>\nwebsites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris\">https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp\">https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email, or join our Iris<br>\ncommunity chat room: Iris Chat Room: <a href=\"https://iris-project.org/chat.html\">https://iris-project.org/chat.html</a>.</p>\n<p>We are also happy to announce iris-contrib<br>\n(<a href=\"https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris-contrib\">https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris-contrib</a>) on behalf of the iris-contrib<br>\nmaintainers:<br>\nIris-contrib is meant to collect community additions to Iris and std++,<br>\nespecially in the form of utility lemmas. As such, it is the ideal destination<br>\nfor the collected lemmas in everyone's util.v files. :) And if you need a lemma<br>\nthat you cannot find in Iris or std++, maybe someone has already proved it in<br>\niris-contrib!<br>\nIris-contrib has low requirements for MRs (see the README) -- as long as it<br>\ncompiles and you put your lemmas in sensible places, you should be good. The<br>\nplan for popular additions is to eventually upstream them to Iris or std++. We<br>\nhope that iris-contrib will also be a useful staging ground for trying out and<br>\ndiscussing additions.<br>\nIris-contrib is maintained by Vincent Lafeychine and Lennard Gäher. We aim to<br>\nensure compatibility with Iris master and that iris-contrib always builds, but<br>\nprovide no further stability guarantees.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nThe Iris and std++ teams</p>\n</blockquote>",
