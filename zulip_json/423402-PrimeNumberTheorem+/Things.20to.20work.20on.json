(We've been organizing things off of the main PNT+ thread, so the newcomers at the workshop could work without getting scooped by the pro's... I'm giving them one more week or so to wrap up their work, and then will report here the progress and anything that remains.)<br>\nAs far as next steps, indeed, as soon as <code>MediumPNT</code> is done, I'd like to propose that we pause progress and try to go back to the beginning, refactor/clean everything up, and try to break it into lots of small pieces to go into Mathlib.</p>",
