This is a really big job, requiring that we go back through the various files (of which there are very many, with many varied degrees of code quality...), decide which things to clean, where to make better API (or even perhaps write some tactics -- for example, it'd be great if there were a filter version of <code>bound</code>?), etc etc. </p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks all for your very hard work on this; it was truly a big team effort, and great fun to collaborate with everyone!</p>",
