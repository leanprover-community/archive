As in, do we leave comments on smaller lemmas, keep them uncommented, do we leave white spaces between local lemmas (have:), should we annotate them with a single liner, etc. Especially at a time where I, and many other newlings are coming to this project from the current hyper around auto formalization tools, a strong standard can keep the backlog clean and can create stricter PR rules.</p>\n<p>I feel like in this manner, we can create a more maintainable codebase and a more maintainable PR list, especially when over time parts of our code might get merged in mathlib in some capacity, and we can reduce refactoring time in the future.</p>\n<p>What do you guys think? Keep it quite loose as it is right now, or enforce some stricter rules?</p>",
