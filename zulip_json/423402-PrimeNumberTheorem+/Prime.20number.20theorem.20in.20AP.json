One natural target is the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions, which we are close to being able to derive via the Wiener-Ikehara method: I have opened up <a href=\"https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/pull/541\">PNT#541</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/pull/542\">PNT#542</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/pull/543\">PNT#543</a> PNT <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/592\">#592</a> to finish this off.  It is conceivable that some of the proofs here are too long for a single formalization task, and may need to be broken up into subtasks; if you are interested in formalizing a portion of one of these tasks and need help breaking up the theorem into more manageable pieces, let me know and I can try to work on this. (EDIT: I just learned that one can assign a \"size\" to each task.  I am therefore classifying these tasks as \"medium\", but potentially splittable into \"small\" tasks.)</p>\n<p>There are also a few loose ends in Consequences.Lean; I have added <a href=\"https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/pull/540\">PNT#540</a> to finish off one of these.  The ones involving the Chebotarev density theorem are much further away from completion (at some point I actually need to find a proof of this theorem that I understand), so I will focus on these more achievable goals for now.</p>",
