So I would like to open a discussion on what the best practices on this should be.  Is there some way to prompt any PR submitter to either declare that their code is human generated, or to disclose AI usage?  We could rely on self-disclosed sentences attached to each PR but it will be all too easy to forget to do such a disclosure.</p>",

To allow for easier inspection of that process I used <a href=\"https://github.com/daaain/claude-code-log\">claude-code-log</a>, which generates an interactive html page containing the entire session (prompts, tool calls, etc.). A readme plus all of the relevant files <a href=\"https://github.com/e-vergo/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/blob/main/chat_logs/README.md\">can be found here</a>.</p>\n<p>The PR was vibe proven last week at the NYC meetup and after the LLM completed the proof inspecting the logs was informative. People are using a variety of tools, many of which don't enable something like this so I don't think it can be a requirement but I think it's important to try out things like this while you are in the thick of things.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/vAQj9MIdB5rUve1vkG0_vskM/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-2.28.13PM.png\">Screenshot 2026-01-16 at 2.28.13 PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/vAQj9MIdB5rUve1vkG0_vskM/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-2.28.13PM.png\" title=\"Screenshot 2026-01-16 at 2.28.13 PM.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"2622x1784\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/3121/vAQj9MIdB5rUve1vkG0_vskM/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-2.28.13PM.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
