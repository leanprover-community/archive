I think those would be useful to have even without PNT, for example for prooving Chebyshev and Mertens type estimates.</p>\n<p>Firstly are people happy for me to do this?</p>\n<p>Secondly I was wondering what the correct thing to do concerning authorship is.  Should the author listed in the Mathlib file be the name of the person who upstreamed, wwith a reference to the PNT project in the docstring, or should the original PNT contributors be listed? I assume the author has to be an actual person rather than just saying PrimeNumberTheoremAnd, it may not always be clear who actually contributed parts of our files without going back through the git history.  Personally I have no strong views here but it would be useful to know what is compliant with Mathlib requirements whilst also recognising everyones contributions.</p>",
